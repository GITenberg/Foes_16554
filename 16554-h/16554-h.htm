<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Said Mother Binning: "Whiles I spin and whiles
I dream. A bonny day like this I look."</p>

<p>English Strickland, tutor at Glenfernie House,
looked, too, at the feathery glen, vivid in June sunshine.
The ash-tree before Mother Binning's cot
overhung a pool of the little river. Below, the
water brawled and leaped from ledge to ledge, but
here at the head of the glen it ran smooth and still.
A rose-bush grew by the door and a hen and her chicks
crossed in the sun. English Strickland, who had been
fishing, sat on the door-stone and talked to Mother
Binning, sitting within with her wheel beside her.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mother, to have the second sight?"</p>

<p>"It's to see behind the here and now. Why're
ye asking?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could buy it or slave for it!" said Strickland.
"Over and over again I really need to see
behind the here and now!"</p>

<p>"Aye. It's needed mair really than folk think.
It's no' to be had by buying nor slaving. How are
the laird and the leddy?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>"Why, well. Tell me," said Strickland, "some
of the things you've seen with second sight."</p>

<p>"It taks inner ears for inner things."</p>

<p>"How do you know I haven't them?"</p>

<p>"Maybe 'tis so. Ye're liked well enough."</p>

<p>Mother Binning looked at the dappling water and
the June trees and the bright blue sky. It was a day
to loosen tongue.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you ane thing I saw. It's mair than
twenty years since James Stewart, that was son of
him who fled, wad get Scotland and England again
intil his hand. So the laddie came frae overseas,
and made stir and trouble enough, I tell ye!... Now
I'll show you what I saw, I that was a
young woman then, and washing my wean's claes in
the water there. The month was September, and
the year seventeen fifteen. Mind you, nane hereabouts
knew yet of thae goings-on!... I sat back
on my heels, with Jock's sark in my hand, and a
lav'rock was singing, and whiles I listened the pool
grew still. And first it was blue glass under blue sky,
and I sat caught. And then it was curled cloud or
milk, and then it was nae color at all. And then I
<i>saw</i>, and 'twas as though what I saw was around
me. There was a town nane like Glenfernie, and a
country of mountains, and a water no' like this one.
There pressed a thrang of folk, and they were Hieland
men and Lowland men, but mair Hieland than
Lowland, and there were chiefs and chieftains and
Lowland lords, and there were pipers. I heard
naught, but it was as though bright shadows were
around me. There was a height like a Good People's
mount, and a braw fine-clad lord speaking and
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>reading frae a paper, and by him a surpliced man
to gie a prayer, and there was a banner pole, and
it went up high, and it had a gowd ball atop. The
braw lord stopped speaking, and all the Hielandmen
and Lowlandmen drew and held up and brandished
their claymores and swords. The flash ran around
like the levin. I kenned that they shouted, all thae
gay shadows! I saw the pipers' cheeks fill with
wind, and the bags of the pipes fill. Then ane drew
on a fine silken rope, and up the pole there went a
braw silken banner, and it sailed out in the wind.
And there was mair shouting and brandishing. But
what think ye might next befall? That gowden
ball, gowden like the sun before it drops, that topped
the pole, it fell! I marked it fall, and the heads
dodge, and it rolled upon the ground.... And then
all went out like a candle that you blaw upon. I
was kneeling by the water, and Jock's sark in my
hand, and the lav'rock singing, and that was all."</p>

<p>"I have heard tell of that," said Strickland. "It
was near Braemar."</p>

<p>"And that's mony a lang league frae here! Sax
days, and we had news of the rising, with the gathering
at Braemar. And said he wha told us, 'The
gilt ball fell frae the standard pole, and there's nane
to think that a good omen!' But I <i>saw</i> it," said
Mother Binning. She turned her wheel, a woman
not yet old and with a large, tranquil comeliness.
"What I see makes fine company!"</p>

<p>Strickland plucked a rose and smelled it. "This
country is fuller of such things than is England that
I come from."</p>

<p>"Aye. It's a grand country." She continued to
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>spin. The tutor looked at the sun. It was time to
be going if he wished another hour with the stream.
He took up his rod and book and rose from the door-step.
Mother Binning glanced aside from her wheel.</p>

<p>"How gaes things with the lad at the House?"</p>

<p>"Alexander or James?"</p>

<p>"The one ye call Alexander."</p>

<p>"That is his name."</p>

<p>"I think that he's had ithers. That's a lad of
mony lives!"</p>

<p>Strickland, halting by the rose-bush, looked at
Mother Binning. "I suppose we call it 'wisdom'
when two feel alike. Now that's just what I feel
about Alexander Jardine! It's just feeling without
rationality."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any reason in it."</p>

<p>"I dinna know about 'reason.' There's <i>being</i> in
it."</p>

<p>The tutor made as if to speak further, then, with
a shake of his head, thought better of it. Thirty-five
years old, he had been a tutor since he was
twenty, dwelling, in all, in four or five more or less
considerable houses and families. Experience, adding
itself to innate good sense, had made him slow
to discuss idiosyncrasies of patrons or pupils. Strong
perplexity or strong feeling might sometimes drive
him, but ordinarily he kept a rein on speech. Now
he looked around him.</p>

<p>"What high summer, lovely weather!"</p>

<p>"Oh aye! It's bonny. Will ye be gaeing, since
ye have na mair to say?"</p>

<p>English Strickland laughed and said good-by to
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>Mother Binning and went. The ash-tree, the hazels
that fringed the water, a point of mossy rock, hid the
cot. The drone of the wheel no longer reached his
ears. It was as though all that had sunk into
the earth. Here was only the deep, the green, and
lonely glen. He found a pool that invited, cast, and
awaited the speckled victim. In the morning he had
had fair luck, but now nothing.... The water
showed no more diamonds, the lower slopes of the
converging hills grew a deep and slumbrous green.
Above was the gold, shoulder and crest powdered
with it, unearthly, uplifted. Strickland ceased his
fishing. The light moved slowly upward; the trees,
the crag-heads, melted into heaven; while the lower
glen lay in lengths of shadow, in jade and amethyst.
A whispering breeze sprang up, cool as the water
sliding by. Strickland put up his fisherman's gear
and moved homeward, down the stream.</p>

<p>He had a very considerable way to go. The glen
path, narrow and rough, went up and down, still
following the water. Hazel and birch, oak and pine,
overhung and darkened it. Bosses of rock thrust
themselves forward, patched with lichen and moss,
seamed and fringed with fern and heath. Roots of
trees, huge and twisted, spread and clutched like
guardian serpents. In places where rock had fallen
the earth seemed to gape. In the shadow it looked
a gnome world&mdash;a gnome or a dragon world. Then
upon ledge or bank showed bells or disks or petaled
suns of June flowers, rose and golden, white and
azure, while overhead was heard the evening song
of birds alike calm and merry, and through a cleft
in the hills poured the ruddy, comfortable sun.</p>

<p><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>The walls declined in height, sloped farther back.
The path grew broader; the water no longer fell
roaring, but ran sedately between pebbled beaches.
The scene grew wider, the mouth of the glen was
reached. He came out into a sunset world of dale
and moor and mountain-heads afar. There were
fields of grain, and blue waving feathers from
chimneys of cottage and farm-house. In the distance
showed a village, one street climbing a hill,
and atop a church with a spire piercing the clear east.
The stream widened, flowing thin over a pebbly bed.
The sun was not yet down. It painted a glory
in the west and set lanes and streets of gold over the
hills and made the little river like Pactolus. Strickland
approached a farm-house, prosperous and venerable,
mended and neat. Thatched, long, white, and
low, behind it barns and outbuildings, it stood
tree-guarded, amid fields of young corn. Beyond
it swelled a long moorside; in front slipped the still
stream.</p>

<p>There were stepping-stones across the stream.
Two young girls, coming toward the house, had set
foot upon these. Strickland, halting in the shadow
of hazels and young aspens, watched them as they
crossed. Their step was free and light; they came
with a kind of hardy grace, elastic, poised, and very
young, homeward from some visit on this holiday.
The tutor knew them to be Elspeth and Gilian Barrow,
granddaughters of Jarvis Barrow of White Farm.
The elder might have been fifteen, the younger
thirteen years. They wore their holiday dresses.
Elspeth had a green silken snood, and Gilian a blue.
Elspeth sang as she stepped from stone to stone:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></p>
<span class="i0">"But I will get a bonny boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I will sail the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I maun gang to Love Gregor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since he canna come hame to me&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They did not see Strickland where he stood by the
hazels. He let them go by, watching them with a
quiet pleasure. They took the upward-running lane.
Hawthorns in bloom hid them; they were gone like
young deer. Strickland, crossing the stream, went
his own way.</p>

<p>The country became more open, with, at this hour,
a dreamlike depth and hush. Down went the sun,
but a glow held and wrapped the earth in hues of
faery. When he had walked a mile and more he
saw before him Glenfernie House. In the modern
and used moiety seventy years old, in the ancient
keep and ruin of a tower three hundred, it crowned&mdash;the
ancient and the latter-day&mdash;a craggy hill set
with dark woods, and behind it came up like a
wonder lantern, like a bubble of pearl, the full moon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>The tutor, in his own room, put down his
fisherman's rod and bag. The chamber was
a small one, set high up, with two deep windows
tying the interior to the yet rosy west and the clearer,
paler south. Strickland stood a moment, then went
out at door and down three steps and along a passageway
to two doors, one closed, the other open.
He tapped upon the latter.</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>A boy of fourteen, tall and fair, with a flushed,
merry face, crossed the room and opened the
door more widely. "Oh, aye, Mr. Strickland,
I'm in!"</p>

<p>"Is Alexander?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I haven't seen him. I was at the
village with Dandie Saunderson."</p>

<p>"Do you know what he did with himself?"</p>

<p>"Not precisely."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, it's nearly supper-time."</p>

<p>Back in his own quarters, the tutor made such
changes as were needed, and finally stood forth in
a comely suit of brown, with silver-buckled shoes,
stock and cravat of fine cambric, and a tie-wig.
Midway in his toilet he stopped to light two candles.
These showed, in the smallest of mirrors, set of wig
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>and cravat, and between the two a thoughtful,
cheerful, rather handsome countenance.</p>

<p>He had left the door ajar so that he might hear,
if he presently returned, his eldest pupil. But he
heard only James go clattering down the passage
and the stair. Strickland, blowing out his candles,
left his room to the prolonged June twilight and the
climbing moon.</p>

<p>The stairway down, from landing to landing, lay
in shadow, but as he approached the hall he caught
the firelight. The laird had a London guest who
might find a chill in June nights so near the north.
The blazing wood showed forth the chief Glenfernie
gathering-place, wide and deep, with a great chimneypiece
and walls of black oak, and hung thereon
some old pieces of armor and old weapons. There
was a table spread for supper, and a servant went
about with a long candle-lighter, lighting candles.
A collie and a hound lay upon the hearth. Between
them stood Mrs. Jardine, a tall, fair woman of forty
and more, with gray eyes, strong nose, and humorous
mouth.</p>

<p>"Light them all, Davie! It'll be dark then by
London houses."</p>

<p>Davie showed an old servant's familiarity. "He
wasna sae grand when he left auld Scotland thirty
years since! I'm thinking he might remember when
he had nae candles ava in his auld hoose."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll have candles enough in his new hall."</p>

<p>Davie lit the last candle. "They say that he is
sinfu' rich!"</p>

<p>"Rich enough to buy Black Hill," said Mrs. Jardine,
and turned to the fire. The tutor joined her
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>there. He had for her liking and admiration, and
she for him almost a motherly affection. Now she
smiled as he came up.</p>

<p>"Did you have good fishing?"</p>

<p>"Only fair."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jardine and Mr. Touris have just returned.
They rode to Black Hill. Have you seen
Alexander?"</p>

<p>"No. I asked Jamie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So did I. But he could not tell."</p>

<p>"He may have gone over the moor and been
belated. Bran is with him."</p>

<p>"Yes.... He's a solitary one, with a thousand in
himself!"</p>

<p>"You're the second woman," remarked Strickland,
"who's said that to-day," and told her of
Mother Binning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jardine pushed back a fallen ember with
the toe of her shoe. "I don't know whether she
sees or only thinks she sees. Some do the tane and
some do the tither. Here's the laird."</p>

<p>Two men entered together&mdash;a large man and a
small man. The first, great of height and girth,
was plainly dressed; the last, seeming slighter by
contrast than he actually was, wore fine cloth, silken
hose, gold buckles to his shoes, and a full wig. The
first had a massive, somewhat saturnine countenance,
the last a shrewd, narrow one. The first had a long
stride and a wide reach from thumb to little finger,
the last a short step and a cupped hand. William
Jardine, laird of Glenfernie, led the way to the fire.</p>

<p>"The ford was swollen. Mr. Touris got a little
wet and chilled."</p>

<p><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>"Ah, the fire is good!" said Mr. Touris. "They
do not burn wood like this in London!"</p>

<p>"You will burn it at Black Hill. I hope that you
like it better and better?"</p>

<p>"It has possibilities, ma'am. Undoubtedly," said
Mr. Touris, the Scots adventurer for fortune, set up
as merchant-trader in London, making his fortune
by "interloping" voyages to India, but now shareholder
and part and lot of the East India Company&mdash;"undoubtedly
the place has possibilities." He
warmed his hands. "Well, it would taste good to
come back to Scotland&mdash;!" His words might have
been finished out, "and laird it, rich and influential,
where once I went forth, cadet of a good family, but
poorer than a church mouse!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jardine made a murmur of hope that he
<i>would</i> come back to Scotland. But the laird looked
with a kind of large gloom at the reflection of fire
and candle in battered breastplate and morion and
crossed pikes.</p>

<p>Supper was brought in by two maids, Eppie and
Phemie, and with them came old Lauchlinson, the
butler. Mrs. Jardine placed herself behind the silver
urn, and Mr. Touris was given the seat nearest the
fire. The boy James appeared, and with him the
daughter of the house, Alice, a girl of twelve, bonny
and merry.</p>

<p>"Where is Alexander?" asked the laird.</p>

<p>Strickland answered. "He is not in yet, sir. I
fancy that he walked to the far moor. Bran is
with him."</p>

<p>"He's a wanderer!" said the laird. "But he
ought to keep hours."</p>

<p><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>"That's a fine youth!" quoth Mr. Touris, drinking
tea. "I marked him yesterday, casting the bar.
Very strong&mdash;a powerful frame like yours, Glenfernie!
When is he going to college?"</p>

<p>"This coming year. I have kept him by me
late," said the laird, broodingly. "I like my bairns
at home."</p>

<p>"Aye, but the young will not stay as they used
to! They will be voyaging," said the guest. "They
build outlandish craft and forthfare, no matter what
you cry to them!" His voice had a mordant note.
"I know. I've got one myself&mdash;a nephew, not a
son. But I am his guardian and he's in my house,
and it is the same. If I buy Black Hill, Glenfernie,
I hope that your son and my nephew may be friends.
They're about of an age."</p>

<p>The listening Jamie spoke from beyond Strickland.
"What's your nephew's name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ian. Ian Rullock. His father's mother was a
Highland lady, near kinswoman to Gordon of Huntley."
Mr. Touris was again speaking to his host.
"As a laddie, before his father's death (his mother,
my sister, died at his birth), he was much with
those troublous northern kin. His father took
him, too, in England, here and there among the
Tory crowd. But I've had him since he was twelve
and am carrying him on in the straight Whig
path."</p>

<p>"And in the true Presbyterian religion?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that," said Mr. Touris, "his father
was of the Church Episcopal in Scotland. I trust
that we are all Christians, Glenfernie!"</p>

<p>The laird made a dissenting sound. "I kenned,"
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>he said, and his voice held a grating gibe, "that
you had left the Kirk."</p>

<p>Mr. Archibald Touris sipped his tea. "I did not
leave it so far, Glenfernie, that I cannot return! In
England, for business reasons, I found it wiser to live
as lived the most that I served. Naaman was permitted
to bow himself in the house of Rimmon."</p>

<p>"You are not Naaman," answered the laird.
"Moreover, I hold that Naaman sinned!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jardine would make a diversion. "Mr. Jardine,
will you have sugar to your tea? Mr. Strickland
says the great pine is blown down, this side the
glen. The <i>Mercury</i> brings us news of the great
world, Mr. Touris, but I dare say you can give us
more?"</p>

<p>"The chief news, ma'am, is that we want war
with Spain and Walpole won't give it to us. But
we'll have it&mdash;British trade must have it or lower her
colors to the Dons! France, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>Supper went on, with abundant and good food and
drink. The laird sat silent. Strickland gave Mrs.
Jardine yeoman aid. Jamie and Alice now listened
to the elders, now in an undertone discoursed their
own affairs. Mr. Touris talked, large trader talk,
sprinkled with terms of commerce and Indian
policy. Supper over, all rose. The table was
cleared, wine and glasses brought and set upon it,
between the candles. The young folk vanished.
Bright as was the night, the air carried an edge.
Mr. Touris, standing by the fire, warmed himself
and took snuff. Strickland, who had left the hall,
returned and placed her embroidery frame for Mrs.
Jardine.</p>

<p><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>"Is Alexander in yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>She began to work in cross-stitch upon a wreath
of tulips and roses. The tutor took his book and
withdrew to the table and the candles thereon. The
laird came and dropped his great form upon the
settle. He held silence a few moments, then began
to speak.</p>

<p>"I am fifty years old. I was a bairn just talking
and toddling about the year the Stewart fled and
King William came to England. My father had
Campbell blood in him and was a friend of Argyle's.
The estate of Glenfernie was not to him then, but
his uncle held it and had an heir of his body. My
father was poor save in stanchness to the liberties
of Kirk and kingdom. My mother was a minister's
daughter, and she and her father and mother were
among the persecuted for the sake of the true Reformed
and Covenanted Church of Scotland. My
mother had a burn in her cheek. It was put there,
when she was a young lass, by order of Grierson of
Lagg. She was set among those to be sold into the
plantations in America. A kinsman who had power
lifted her from that bog, but much she suffered before
she was freed.... When I was little and sat
upon her knee I would put my forefinger in that
mark. 'It's a seal, laddie,' she would say. 'Sealed
to Christ and His true Kirk!' But when I was
bigger I only wanted to meet Grierson of Lagg, and
grieved that he was dead and gone and that Satan,
not I, had the handling of him. My grandfather
and mother.... My grandfather was among the
outed ministers in Galloway. Thrust from his
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>church and his parish, he preached upon the moors&mdash;yea,
to juniper and whin-bush and the whaups
that flew and nested! Then the persecuted men,
women and bairns, gathered there, and he preached
to them. Aye, and he was at Bothwell Bridge.
Claverhouse's men took him, and he lay for some
months in the Edinburgh tolbooth, and then by
Council and justiciary was condemned to be hanged.
And so he was hanged at the cross of Edinburgh.
And what he said before he died was '<i>With what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you</i>' ... My
grandmother, for hearing preaching in the fields
and for sheltering the distressed for the Covenant's
sake, was sent with other godly women to the Bass
Rock. There in cold and heat, in hunger and sickness,
she bided for two years. When at last they
let her body forth her mind was found to be broken....
My father and mother married and lived, until
Glenfernie came to him, at Windygarth. I was
born at Windygarth. My grandmother lived with
us. I was twelve years old before she went from
earth. It was all her pleasure to be forth from
the house&mdash;any house, for she called them all
prisons. So I was sent to ramble with her. Out of
doors, with the harmless things of earth, she was
wise enough&mdash;and good company. The old of this
countryside remember us, going here and there....
I used to think, 'If I had been living then, I would
not have let those things happen!' And I dreamed
of taking coin, and of dropping the same coin into
the hands that gave.... And so, the other having
served your turn, Touris, you will change back to
the true Kirk?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>Mr. Touris handled his snuff-box, considered the
chasing upon the gold lid. "Those were sore happenings,
Glenfernie, but they're past! I make no
wonder that, being you, you feel as you do. But
the world's in a mood, if I may say it, not to take
so hardly religious differences. I trust that I am
as religious as another&mdash;but my family was always
moderate there. In matters political the world's
as hot as ever&mdash;but there, too, it is my instinct to
ca' canny. But if you talk of trade"&mdash;he tapped
his snuff-box&mdash;"I will match you, Glenfernie! If
there's wrong, pay it back! Hold to your principles!
But do it cannily. Smile when there's smart, and
get your own again by being supple. In the end
you'll demand&mdash;and get&mdash;a higher interest. Prosper
at your enemy's cost, and take repayment for your
hurt sugared and spiced!"</p>

<p>"I'll not do it so!" said Glenfernie. "But I
would take my stand at the crag's edge and cry to
Grierson of Lagg, 'You or I go down!'"</p>

<p>Mr. Touris brushed the snuff from his ruffles.
"It's a great century! We're growing enlightened."</p>

<p>With a movement of her fingers Mrs. Jardine
helped to roll from her lap a ball of rosy wool. "Mr.
Jardine, will you give me that? Had you heard
that Abercrombie's cows were lifted?"</p>

<p>"Aye, I heard. What is it, Holdfast?"</p>

<p>Both dogs had raised their heads.</p>

<p>"Bran is outside," said Strickland.</p>

<p>As he spoke the door opened and there came in a
youth of seventeen, tall and well-built, with clothing
that testified to an encounter alike with brier and
bog. The hound Bran followed him. He blinked
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>at the lights and the fire, then with a gesture of
deprecation crossed the hall to the stairway. His
mother spoke after him.</p>

<p>"Davie will set you something to eat."</p>

<p>He answered, "I do not want anything," then,
five steps up, paused and turned his head. "I
stopped at White Farm, and they gave me supper."
He was gone, running up the stairs, and Bran with
him.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie shaded his eyes and
looked at the fire. Mrs. Jardine, working upon the
gold streak in a tulip, held her needle suspended and
sat for a moment with unseeing gaze, then resumed
the bright wreath. The tutor began to think again
of Mother Binning, and, following this, of the
stepping-stones at White Farm, and Elspeth and
Gilian Barrow balanced above the stream of gold.
Mr. Touris put up his snuff-box.</p>

<p>"That's a fine youth! I should say that he took
after you, Glenfernie. But it's hard to tell whom
the young take after!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The school-room at Glenfernie gave upon the
hill's steepest, most craglike face. A door
opened on a hand's-breadth of level turf across from
which rose the broken and ruined wall that once
had surrounded the keep. Ivy overgrew this; below
a wide and ragged breach a pine had set its
roots in the hillside. Its top rose bushy above the
stones. Beyond the opening, one saw from the
school-room, as through a window, field and stream
and moor, hill and dale. The school-room had been
some old storehouse or office. It was stone walled
and floored, with three small windows and a fireplace.
Now it contained a long table with a bench and
three or four chairs, a desk and shelves for books.
One door opened upon the little green and the wall;
a second gave access to a courtyard and the rear of
the new house.</p>

<p>Here on a sunny, still August forenoon Strickland
and the three Jardines went through the educational
routine. The ages of the pupils were not sufficiently
near together to allow of a massed instruction. The
three made three classes. Jamie and Alice worked
in the school-room, under Strickland's eye. But
Alexander had or took a wider freedom. It was his
wont to prepare his task much where he pleased,
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>coming to the room for recitation or for colloquy
upon this or that aspect of knowledge and the
attainment thereof. The irregularity mattered the
less as the eldest Jardine combined with a passion
for personal liberty and out of doors a passion for
knowledge. Moreover, he liked and trusted Strickland.
He would go far, but not far enough to strain
the tutor's patience. His father and mother and all
about Glenfernie knew his way and in a measure
acquiesced. He had managed to obtain for himself
range. Young as he was, his indrawing, outpushing
force was considerable, and was on the way, Strickland
thought, to increase in power. The tutor had
for this pupil a mixed feeling. The one constant in
it was interest. He was to him like a deep lake,
clear enough to see that there was something at the
bottom that cast conflicting lights and hints of shape.
It might be a lump of gold, or a coil of roots which
would send up a water-lily, or it might be something
different. He had a feeling that the depths themselves
hardly knew. Or there might be two things
of two natures down there in the lake....</p>

<p>Strickland set Alice to translating a French fable,
and Jamie to reconsidering a neglected page of
ancient history. Looking through the west window,
he saw that Alexander had taken his geometry out
through the great rent in the wall. Book and student
perched beneath the pine-tree, in a crook made
by rock and brown root, overhanging the autumn
world. Strickland at his own desk dipped quill
into ink-well and continued a letter to a friend in
England. The minutes went by. From the courtyard
came a subdued, cheerful household clack and
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>murmur, voices of men and maids, with once Mrs.
Jardine's genial, vigorous tones, and once the laird's
deep bell note, calling to his dogs. On the western
side fell only the sough of the breeze in the pine.</p>

<p>Jamie ceased the clocklike motion of his body to
and fro over the difficult lesson. "I never understood
just what were the Erinnys, sir?"</p>

<p>"The Erinnys?" Strickland laid down the pen
and turned in his chair. "I'll have to think a
moment, to get it straight for you, Jamie.... The
Erinnys are the Fates as avengers. They are the
vengeance-demanding part of ourselves objectified,
supernaturalized, and named. Of old, where injury
was done, the Erinnys were at hand to pull the roof
down upon the head of the injurer. Their office was
to provide unerringly sword for sword, bitter cup for
bitter cup. They never forgot, they always avenged,
though sometimes they took years to do it. They
esteemed themselves, and were esteemed, essential to
the moral order. They are the dark and bitter extreme
of justice, given power by the imagination....
Do you think that you know the chapter now?"</p>

<p>Jamie achieved his recitation, and then was set
to mathematics. The tutor's quill drove on across
the page. He looked up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Touris has come to Black Hill?"</p>

<p>Jamie and Alice worshiped interruptions.</p>

<p>"He has twenty carriers bringing fine things all
the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother is going to take me when she goes to
see Mrs. Alison, his sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is going to spend money and make friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother says Mrs. Alison was most bonny when
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>she was young, but England may have spoiled
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The minister told the laird that Mr. Touris put
fifty pounds in the plate&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strickland held up his hand, and the scholars,
sighing, returned to work. <i>Buzz, buzz!</i> went the
bees outside the window. The sun climbed high.
Alexander shut his geometry and came through the
break in the wall and across the span of green to
the school-room.</p>

<p>"That's done, Mr. Strickland."</p>

<p>Strickland looked at the paper that his eldest
pupil put before him. "Yes, that is correct. Do
you want, this morning, to take up the reading?"</p>

<p>"I had as well, I suppose."</p>

<p>"If you go to Edinburgh&mdash;if you do as your
father wishes and apply yourself to the law&mdash;you
will need to read well and to speak well. You do
not do badly, but not well enough. So, let's begin!"
He put out his hand and drew from the bookshelf
a volume bearing the title, <i>The Treasury of Orators</i>.
"Try what you please."</p>

<p>Alexander took the book and moved to the unoccupied
window. Here he half sat, half stood, the
morning light flowing in upon him. He opened the
volume and read, with a questioning inflection, the
title beneath his eyes, "'The Cranes of Ibycus'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Strickland. "That is a short,
graphic thing."</p>

<p>Alexander read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ibycus, who sang of love, material and divine, in Rhegium
and in Samos, would wander forth in the world and make his
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>lyre sound now by the sea and now in the mountain. Wheresoever
he went he was clad in the favor of all who loved song.
He became a wandering minstrel-poet. The shepherd loved him,
and the fisher; the trader and the mechanic sighed when he
sang; the soldier and the king felt him at their hearts. The old
returned in their thoughts to youth, young men and maidens
trembled in heavenly sound and light. You would think that
all the world loved Ibycus.</p>

<p>"Corinth, the jeweled city, planned her chariot-races and her
festival of song. The strong, the star-eyed young men, traveled
to Corinth from mainland and from island, and those inner
athletes and starry ones, the poets, traveled. Great feasting
was to be in Corinth, and contests of strength and flights of song,
and in the theater, representation of gods and men. Ibycus, the
wandering poet, would go to Corinth, there perhaps to receive
a crown.</p>

<p>"Ibycus, loved of all who love song, traveled alone, but not
alone. Yet shepherds, or women with their pitchers at the
spring, saw but a poet with a staff and a lyre. Now he was found
upon the highroad, and now the country paths drew him, and
the solemn woods where men most easily find God. And so he
approached Corinth.</p>

<p>"The day was calm and bright, with a lofty, blue, and stainless
sky. The heart of Ibycus grew warm, and there seemed a brighter
light within the light cast by the sun. Flower and plant and
tree and all living things seemed to him to be glistening and
singing, and to have for him, as he for them, a loving friendship.
And, looking up to the sky, he saw, drawn out stringwise, a flight
of cranes, addressed to Egypt. And between his heart and them
ran, like a rippling path that the sun sends across the sea, a
stream of good-will and understanding. They seemed a part of
himself, winged in the blue heaven, and aware of the part of him
that trod earth, that was entering the grave and shadowy wood
that neighbored Corinth.</p>

<p>"The cranes vanished from overhead, the sky arched without
stain. Ibycus, the sacred poet, with his staff and his lyre, went
on into the wood. Now the light faded and there was green
gloom, like the depths of Father Sea.</p>

<p>"Now robbers lay masked in the wood&mdash;"</p></div>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>Jamie and Alice sat very still, listening. Strickland
kept his eyes on the reading youth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now robbers lay masked in the wood&mdash;violent men and
treacherous, watching for the unwary, to take from them goods
and, if they resisted, life. In a dark place they lay in wait, and
from thence they sprang upon Ibycus. 'What hast thou? Part
it from thyself and leave it with us!'</p>

<p>"Ibycus, who could sing of the wars of the Greeks and the
Trojans no less well than of the joys of young love, made stand,
held close to him his lyre, but raised on high his staff of oak.
Then from behind one struck him with a keen knife, and he sank,
and lay in his blood. The place was the edge of a glade, where the
trees thinned away and the sky might be seen overhead. And
now, across the blue heaven, came a second line of the
south-ward-going
cranes. They flew low, they flapped their wings, and
the wood heard their crying. Then Ibycus the poet raised his
arms to his brothers the birds. 'Ye cranes, flying between earth
and heaven, avenge shed blood, as is right!'</p>

<p>"Hoarse screamed the cranes flying overhead. Ibycus the poet
closed his eyes, pressed his lips to Mother Earth, and died. The
cranes screamed again, circling the wood, then in a long line
sailed southward through the blue air until they might neither be
heard nor seen. The robbers stared after them. They laughed,
but without mirth. Then, stooping to the body of Ibycus, they
would have rifled it when, hearing a sudden sound of men's
voices entering the wood, they took violent fright and fled."</p></div>

<p>Strickland looked still at the reader. Alexander
had straightened himself. He was speaking rather
than reading. His voice had intensities and shadows.
His brows had drawn together, his eyes glowed, and
he stood with nostrils somewhat distended. The
emotion that he plainly showed seemed to gather
about the injury done and the appeal of Ibycus.
The earlier Ibycus had not seemed greatly to interest
him. Strickland was used to stormy youth,
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>to its passional moments, sudden glows, burnings,
sympathies, defiances, lurid shows of effects with
the causes largely unapparent. It was his trade to
know youth, and he had a psychologist's interest.
He said now to himself, "There is something in his
character that connects itself with, that responds
to, the idea of vengeance." There came into his
memory the laird's talk, the evening of Mr. Touris's
visit, in June. Glenfernie, who would have wrestled
with Grierson of Lagg at the edge of the pit; Glenfernie's
mother and father, who might have had
much the same feeling; their forebears beyond them
with like sensations toward the Griersons of their
day.... The long line of them&mdash;the long line of
mankind&mdash;injured and injurers....</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Travelers through the wood, whose voices the robbers heard,
found Ibycus the poet lying upon the ground, ravished of life.
It chanced that he had been known of them, known and loved.
Great mourning arose, and vain search for them who had done
this wrong. But those strong, wicked ones were gone, fled from
their haunts, fled from the wood afar to Corinth, for the god
Pan had thrown against them a pine cone. So the travelers took
the body of Ibycus and bore it with them to Corinth.</p>

<p>"A poet had been slain upon the threshold of the house of song.
Sacred blood had spattered the white robes of a queen dressed
for jubilee. Evil unreturned to its doers must darken the sunshine
of the famous days. Corinth uttered a cry of lamentation
and wrath. 'Where are the ill-doers, the spillers of blood, that
we may spill their blood and avenge Ibycus, showing the gods
that we are their helpers?' But those robbers and murderers
might not be found. And the body of Ibycus was consumed
upon a funeral pyre.</p>

<p>"The festival hours went by in Corinth. And now began to fill
the amphitheater where might find room a host for number like
the acorns of Dodona. The throng was huge, the sound that it
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>made like the shock of ocean. Around, tier above tier, swept the
rows, and for roof there was the blue and sunny air. Then the
voice of the sea hushed, for now entered the many-numbered
chorus. Slow-circling, it sang of mighty Fate: '<i>For every word
shall have its echo, and every deed shall see its face. The word
shall say, "Is it my echo?" and the deed shall say, "Is it my
face?"</i>'&mdash;</p>

<p>"The chorus passes, singing. The voices die, there falls a
silence, sent as it were from inner space. The open sky is above
the amphitheater. And now there comes, from north to south,
sailing that sea above, high, but not so high that their shape is
indistinguishable, a long flight of cranes. Heads move, eyes are
raised, but none know why that interest is so keen, so still. Then
from out the throng rises, struck with forgetfulness of gathered
Corinth and of its own reasons for being dumb as is the stone, a
man's voice, and the fear that Pan gives ran yet around in that
voice. 'See, brother, see! The cranes of Ibycus!'</p>

<p>"'Ibycus!' The crowd about those men pressed in upon them.
'What do you know of Ibycus?' And great Pan drove them to
show in their faces what they knew. So Corinth took&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>Alexander Jardine shut the book and, leaving the
window, dropped it upon the table. His hand shook,
his face was convulsed. "I've read as far as needs
be. Those things strike me like hammers!" With
suddenness he turned and was gone.</p>

<p>Strickland was aware that he might not return
that day to the school-room, perhaps not to the
house. He went out of the west door and across
the grassy space to the gap in the wall, through
which he disappeared. Beyond was the rough
descent to wood and stream.</p>

<p>Jamie spoke: "He's a queer body! He says he
thinks that he lived a long time ago, and then a
shorter time ago, and then now. He says that some
days he sees it all come up in a kind of dark desert."</p>

<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>Alice put in her word, "Mother says he's many in
one, and that the many and one don't yet recognize
each other."</p>

<p>"Your mother is a wise woman," said the tutor.
"Let me see how the work goes."</p>

<p>The pine-tree, outside the wall, overhung a rude
natural stairway of stony ledge and outcropping
root with patches of moss and heath. Down this
went Alexander into a cool dimness of fir and oak and
birch, watered by a little stream. He kneeled by
this, he cooled face and hands in the water, then
flung himself beneath a tree and, burying his head
in his arms, lay still. The waves within subsided,
sank to a long, deep swell, then from that to quiet.
The door that wind and tide had beaten open shut
again. Alexander lay without thinking, without
overmuch feeling. At last, turning, he opened his
eyes upon the tree-tops and the August sky. The
door was shut upon tales of injury and revenge.
Between boy and man, he lay in a yearning stillness,
colors and sounds and dim poetic strains his ministers
of grace. This lasted for a time, then he rose, first
to a sitting posture, then to his feet. Crows flew
through the wood; he had a glimpse of yellow fields
and purple heath. He set forth upon one of the long
rambles which were a prized part of life.</p>

<p>An hour or so later he stopped at a cotter's, some
miles from home. An old man and a woman gave
him an oat cake and a drink of home-brewed. He
was fond of folk like these&mdash;at home with them and
they with him. There was no need to make talk,
but he sat and looked at the marigolds while the
woman moved about and the old man wove rushes
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>into mats. From here he took to the hills and
walked awhile with a shepherd numbering his sheep.
Finally, in mid-afternoon, he found himself upon a
heath, bare of trees, lifted and purple.</p>

<p>He sat down amid the warm bloom; he lay down.
Within was youth's blind tumult and longing, a
passioning for he knew not what. "I wish that
there were great things in my life. I wish that I
were a discoverer, sailing like Columbus. I wish
that I had a friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>He fell into a day-dream, lapped there in warm
purple waves, hearing the bees' interminable murmur.
He faced, across a narrow vale, an abrupt,
curiously shaped hill, dark with outstanding granite
and with fir-trees. Where at the eastern end it
broke away, where at its base the vale widened,
shone among the lively green of elms turrets and
chimneys of a large house. "Black Hill&mdash;Black
Hill&mdash;Black Hill...."</p>

<p>A youth of about his own age came up the path
from the vale. Alexander, lying amid the heath,
caught at some distance the whole figure, but as he
approached lost him. Then, near at hand, the
head rose above the brow of the ridge. It was a
handsome head, with a cap and feather, with gold-brown
hair lightly clustering, and a countenance of
spirit and daring with something subtle rubbed in.
Head, shoulders, a supple figure, not so tall nor so
largely made as was Glenfernie's heir, all came upon
the purple hilltop.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Alexander raised himself from his couch in
the heather.</p>

<p>"Good day!" said the new-comer.</p>

<p>"Good day!"</p>

<p>The youth stood beside him. "I am Ian Rullock."</p>

<p>"I am Alexander Jardine."</p>

<p>"Of Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>"Aye, you've got it."</p>

<p>"Then we're the neighbors that are to be friends."</p>

<p>"If we are to be we are to be.... I want a
friend.... I don't know if you're the one that is to
answer."</p>

<p>The other dropped beside him upon the heath.
"I saw you walking along the hilltop. So when you
did not come on I thought I'd climb and meet you.
This is a lonely, miserable country!"</p>

<p>Alexander was moved to defend. "There are
more miserable! It's got its points."</p>

<p>"I don't see them. I want London!"</p>

<p>"That's Babylon.&mdash;It's your own country. You're
evening it with England!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. But you can't deny that it's
poor."</p>

<p>"There's one of its sons, named Touris, that is
not poor!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>Rullock rose upon one knee. "The wise man gets
rich and the fool stays poor. Do you want to be
friends or do you want to fight?"</p>

<p>Alexander clasped his hands behind his head and
lay back upon the earth. "No, I do not want to
fight&mdash;not now! I wouldn't fight you, anyhow,
for standing up for one to whom you're beholden."</p>

<p>Silence fell between them, each having eyes upon
the other. Something drew each to each, something
repelled each from each. It was a question, between
those forces, which would gain. Alexander
did not feel strange with Ian, nor Ian with Alexander.
It was as though they had met before.
But how they had met and why, and where and
when, and what that meeting had entailed and
meant, was hidden from their gaze. The attractive
increased over the repellent. Ian spoke.</p>

<p>"There's none down there but my uncle and his
sister, my aunt. Come on down and let me show
you the place."</p>

<p>"I do not care if I do." He rose, and the two went
along the hilltop and down the path.</p>

<p>Ian was the readier in talk. "I am going soon
to Edinburgh&mdash;to college."</p>

<p>"I'm going, too. The first of the year. I am
going to try if I can stand the law."</p>

<p>"I want to be a soldier."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I want.... I want to journey&mdash;and
journey&mdash;and journey ... with a book along."</p>

<p>"Do you like books?"</p>

<p>"Aye, fine!"</p>

<p>"I like them right well. Are there any pretty girls
around here?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>"I don't know. I don't like girls."</p>

<p>"I like them at times, in their places. You must
wrestle bravely, you're so strong in the shoulder and
long in the arm!"</p>

<p>"You're not so big, but you look strong yourself."</p>

<p>Each measured the other with his eyes. Friendship
was already here. It was as though hand had fitted
into glove.</p>

<p>"What is your dog named?"</p>

<p>"Hector."</p>

<p>"Mine's Bran. You come to Glenfernie to-morrow
and I'll show you a place that's all mine. It's
the room in the old keep. I've books there and apples
and nuts and curiosities. There's a big fireplace,
and my father's let me build a furnace besides, and
I've kettles and crucibles and pans and vials&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>Alexander paused and gazed at Ian, then gave
into his keeping the great secret. "Alchemy. I'm
trying to change lead into gold."</p>

<p>Ian thrilled. "I'll come! I'll ride over. I've a
beautiful mare."</p>

<p>"It's not eight miles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll come. We're just in at Black Hill, you see,
and I've had no time to make a place like that!
But I'll show you my room. Here's the park gate."</p>

<p>They walked up an avenue overarched by elms,
to a house old but not so old, once half-ruinous, but
now mended and being mended, enlarged, and decorated,
the aim a spacious place alike venerable and
modern. Workmen yet swarmed about it. The
whole presented a busy, cheerful aspect&mdash;a gracious
one, also, for under a monster elm before the terrace
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>was found the master and owner, Mr. Archibald
Touris. He greeted the youths with a manner meant
to exhibit the expansive heart of a country gentleman.</p>

<p>"You've found each other out, have you? Why,
you look born to be friends! That's as it should
be.&mdash;And what, Alexander, do you think of Black
Hill?"</p>

<p>"It looks finely a rich man's place, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Touris laughed at his country bluntness, but
did not take the tribute amiss. "Not so rich&mdash;not
so mighty rich. But enough, enough! If Ian here
behaves himself he'll have enough!" A master workman
called him away. He went with a large wave of
the hand. "Make yourself at home, Alexander!
Take him, Ian, to see your aunt Alison." He was
gone with the workman.</p>

<p>"I'll take you there presently," said Ian. "I'm
fond of Aunt Alison&mdash;you'll like her, too&mdash;but she'll
keep. Let's go see my mare Fatima, and then my
room."</p>

<p>Fatima was a most beautiful young, snowy
Arabian. Alexander sighed with delight when they
led her out from her stable and she walked about
with Ian beside her, and when presently Ian mounted
she curveted and caracoled. Ian and she suited each
other. Indefinably, there was about him, too, something
Eastern. The two went to and fro, the mare's
hoofs striking music from the flags. Behind them
ran a gray range of buildings overtopped by bushy
willows. Alexander sat on a stone bench, hugged
his knees, and felt true love for the sight. Ian had
come to him like a gift from the blue.</p>

<p>Ian dismounted, and they watched Fatima dis<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>appear
into her stall. "Come now and see the
house."</p>

<p>The house was large and cumbered with furniture
too much and too rich for the Scotch countryside.
Ian's room had a great, rich bed and a dressing-table
that drew from Alexander a whistle, contemplative
and scornful. But there were other matters besides
luxury of couch and toilet. Slung against the wall
appeared a fine carbine, the pistols and sword of
Ian's father, and a wonderful long, twisted, and
damascened knife or dirk&mdash;creese, Ian called it&mdash;that
had come in some trading-ship of his uncle's. And
he had books in a small closet room, and a picture
that the two stood before.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"There was an Italian who owed my uncle a debt.
He had no money, so he gave him this. He said that
it was painted a long time ago and that it was very
fine."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is a Bible piece. This is a city of refuge. This
is a sinner fleeing to it, and here behind him is the
avenger of blood. You can't see, it is so dark.
There!" He drew the window-curtain quite aside.
A flood of light came in and washed the picture.</p>

<p>"I see. What is it doing here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I liked it. I suppose Aunt Alison
thought it might hang here."</p>

<p>"I like to see pictures in my mind. But things like
that poison me! Let's see the rest of the house."</p>

<p>They went again through Ian's room. Coming to
a fine carved ambry, he hesitated, then stood still.
"I'm going to show you something else! I show it to
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>you because I trust you. It's like your telling me
about your making gold out of lead." He opened a
door of the ambry, pulled out a drawer, and, pressing
some spring, revealed a narrow, secret shelf. His
hand went into the dimness and came out bearing a
silver goblet. This he set carefully upon a neighboring
table, and looked at Alexander somewhat aslant
out of long, golden-brown eyes.</p>

<p>"It's a bonny goblet," said Alexander. "Why do
you keep it like that?"</p>

<p>Ian looked around him. "Years and years ago
my father, who is dead now, was in France. There
was a banquet at Saint-Germain. <i>A very great person</i>
gave it and was in presence himself. All the gentlemen
his guests drank a toast for which the finest
wine was poured in especial goblets. Afterward each
was given for a token the cup from which he drank.... Before
he died my father gave me this. But of
course I have to keep it secret. My uncle and all
the world around here are Whigs!"</p>

<p>"James Stewart!" quoth Alexander. "Humph!"</p>

<p>"Remember that you have not seen it," said Ian,
"and that I never said aught to you but <i>King George,
King George!</i>" With that he restored the goblet to
the secret shelf, put back the drawer, and shut the
ambry door. "Friends trust one another in little and
big.&mdash;Now let's go see Aunt Alison."</p>

<p>They went in silence along a corridor where every
footfall was subdued in India matting. Alexander
spoke once:</p>

<p>"I feel all through me that we're friends. But
you're a terrible fool there!"</p>

<p>"I am not," said Ian. His voice carried the truth
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>of his own feeling. "I am like my father and mother
and the chieftains my kin, and I have been with certain
kings ever since there were kings. Others think
otherwise, but I've got my rights!"</p>

<p>With that they came to the open door of a room.
A voice spoke from within:</p>

<p>"Ian!"</p>

<p>Ian crossed the threshold. "May we come in,
Aunt Alison? It's Alexander Jardine of Glenfernie."</p>

<p>A tall, three-leaved screen pictured with pagodas,
palms, and macaws stood between the door and the
rest of the room. "Come, of course!" said the voice
behind this.</p>

<p>Passing the last pagoda edge, the two entered a
white-paneled parlor where a lady in dove-gray muslin
overlooked the unpacking of fine china. She
turned in the great chair where she sat. "I am truly
glad to see Alexander Jardine!" When he went up
to her she took his two hands in hers. "I remember
your mother and how fine a lassie she was! Good
mind and good heart&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've heard of you, too," answered Alexander.
He looked at her in frank admiration, <i>Eh, but you're
bonny!</i> written in his gaze.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alison, as they called her, was something
more than bonny. She had loveliness. More than
that, she breathed a cleanliness of spirit, a lucid
peace, a fibered self-mastery passing into light.
Alexander did not analyze his feeling for her, but it
was presently one of great liking. Now she sat in
her great chair while the maids went on with the
unpacking, and questioned him about Glenfernie and
all the family and life there. She was slight, not tall,
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>with hair prematurely white, needing no powder.
She sat and talked with her hand upon Ian. While
she talked she glanced from the one youth to the
other. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Alexander Jardine, I love Ian dearly. He needs
and will need love&mdash;great love. If you are going to
be friends, remember that love is bottomless.&mdash;And
now go, the two of you, for the day is getting on."</p>

<p>They passed again the macaw-and-pagoda screen
and left the paneled room. The August light struck
slant and gold. The two quitted the house and
crossed the terrace into the avenue without again
encountering the master of the place.</p>

<p>"I will go with you to the top of the hill," said Ian.
They climbed the ridge that was like a purple cloud.
"I'll come to Glenfernie to-morrow or the next day."</p>

<p>"Yes, come! I'm fond of Jamie, but he's three
years younger than I."</p>

<p>"You've got a sister?"</p>

<p>"Alice? She's only twelve. You come. I've been
wanting somebody."</p>

<p>"So have I. I'm lonelier than you."</p>

<p>They came to the level top of the heath. The
sun rode low; the shadow of the hill stretched at
their feet, out over path and harvest-field.</p>

<p>"Good-by, then!"</p>

<p>"Good-by!"</p>

<p>Ian stood still. Alexander, homeward bound,
dropped over the crest. The earth wave hid from
him Black Hill, house and all. But, looking back,
he could still see Ian against the sky. Then Ian
sank, too. Alexander strode on toward Glenfernie.
He went whistling, in expanded, golden spirits.
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>Ian&mdash;and Ian&mdash;and Ian! Going through a grove
of oaks, blackbirds flew overhead, among and above
the branches. <i>The cranes of Ibycus!</i> The phrase
flashed into mind. "I wonder why things like that
disturb me so!... I wonder if there's any bottom or
top to living anyhow!... I wonder&mdash;!" He looked
at the birds and at the violet evening light at play
in the old wood. The phrase went out of his mind.
He left the remnant of the forest and was presently
upon open moor. He whistled again, loud and clear,
and strode on happily. Ian&mdash;and Ian&mdash;and Ian!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>The House of Glenfernie and the House of Touris
became friends. A round of country festivities,
capped by a great party at Black Hill, wrought bonds
of acquaintanceship for and with the Scots family
returned after long abode in England. Archibald
Touris spent money with a cautious freedom. He
set a table and poured a wine better by half than
might be found elsewhere. He kept good horses and
good dogs. Laborers who worked for him praised
him; he proved a not ungenerous landlord. Where
he recognized obligations he met them punctually.
He had large merchant virtues, no less than the
accompanying limitations. He returned to the
Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie and the laird of Black
Hill found constitutional impediments to their being
more friendly than need be. Each was polite to the
other to a certain point, then the one glowered and
the other scoffed. It ended in a painstaking keeping
of distance between them, a task which, when
they were in company, fell often to Mrs. Jardine.
She did it with tact, with a twist of her large, humorous
mouth toward Strickland if he were by.
Admirable as she was, it was curious to see the difference
between her method, if method there were,
and that of Mrs. Alison. The latter showed no
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>effort, but where she was there fell harmony.
William Jardine liked her, liked to be in the room
with her. His great frame and her slight one, his
rough, massive, somewhat unshaped personality and
her exquisite clearness contrasted finely enough.
Her brother, who understood her very little, yet
had for her an odd, appealing affection, strange in
one who had so positively settled what was life and
the needs of life. It was his habit to speak of her
as though she were more helplessly dependent even
than other women. But at times there might be
seen who was more truly the dependent.</p>

<p>August passed into September, September into
brown October. Alexander and Ian were almost
continually in company. The attraction between
them was so great that it appeared as though it
must stretch backward into some unknown seam of
time. If they had differences, these apparently
only served in themselves to keep them revolving
the one about the other. They might almost quarrel,
but never enough to drag their two orbs apart,
breaking and rending from the common center.
The sun might go down upon a kind of wrath, but
it rose on hearts with the difference forgotten.
Their very unlikenesses pricked each on to seek
himself in the other.</p>

<p>They were going to Edinburgh after Christmas,
to be students there, to grow to be men. Here at
home, upon the eve of their going, rein upon them
was slackened. They would so soon be independent
of home discipline that that independence was to
a degree already allowed. Black Hill did not often
question Ian's comings and goings, nor Glenfernie
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>Alexander's. The school-room saw the latter some
part of each morning. For the rest of the day he
might be almost anywhere with Ian, at Glenfernie,
or at Black Hill, or on the road between, or in the
country roundabout.</p>

<p>William Jardine, chancing to be one day at Black
Hill, watched from Mrs. Alison's parlor the two
going down the avenue, the dogs at their heels.
"It's a fair David and Jonathan business!"</p>

<p>"David needed Jonathan, and Jonathan David."</p>

<p>"Had Jonathan lived, ma'am, and the two come
to conflict about the kingdom, what then, and where
would have flown the friendship?"</p>

<p>"It would have flown on high, I suppose, and
waited for them until they had grown wings to
mount to it."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the laird, "you're one I can follow only
a little way!"</p>

<p>Ian and Alexander felt only that the earth about
them was bright and warm.</p>

<p>On a brown-and-gold day the two found themselves
in the village of Glenfernie. Ian had spent the night
with Alexander&mdash;for some reason there was school
holiday&mdash;the two were now abroad early in the day.
The village sent its one street, its few poor lanes,
up a bare hillside to the church atop. Poor and rude
enough, it had yet to-day its cheerful air. High voices
called, flaxen-haired children pottered about, a mill-wheel
creaked at the foot of the hill, iron clanged in
the smithy a little higher, the drovers' rough laughter
burst from the tavern midway, and at the height
the kirk was seeing a wedding. The air had a tang
of cooled wine, the sky was blue.</p>

<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>Ian and Alexander, coming over the hill, reached
the kirk in time to see emerge the married pair with
their kin and friends. The two stood with a rabble
of children and boys beneath the yew-trees by the
gate. The yellow-haired bride in her finery, the yellow-haired
groom in his, the dressed and festive
following, stepped from the kirkyard to some waiting
carts and horses. The most mounted and took place,
the procession put itself into motion with clatter and
laughter. The children and boys ran after to where
the road dipped over the hill. A cluster of village
folk turned the long, descending street. In passing
they spoke to Alexander and Ian.</p>

<p>"Who was married?&mdash;Jock Wilson and Janet
Macraw, o' Langmuir."</p>

<p>The two lounged against the kirkyard wall, beneath
the yews.</p>

<p>"<i>Marry!</i> That's a strange, terrible, useless word
to me!"</p>

<p>"I don't know...."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is!... Ian, do you ever think that
you've lived before?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm living now!"</p>

<p>"Well, I think that we all lived before. I think
that the same things happen again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let them&mdash;some of them!" said Ian. "Come
along, if we're going through the glen."</p>

<p>They left the kirkyard for the village street. Here
they sauntered, friends with the whole. They looked
in at the tavern upon the drovers, they watched the
blacksmith and his helper. The red iron rang, the
sparks flew. At the foot of the hill flowed the stream
and stood the mill. The wheel turned, the water
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>diamonds dropped in sheets. Their busy, idle day
took them on; they were now in bare, heathy country
with the breathing, winey air. Presently White
Farm could be seen among aspens, and beyond it the
wooded mouth of the glen. Some one, whistling,
turned an elbow of the hill and caught up with the
two. It proved to be one several years their senior,
a young man in the holiday dress of a prosperous
farmer. He whistled clearly an old border air and
walked without dragging or clumsiness. Coming up,
he ceased his whistling.</p>

<p>"Good day, the both of ye!"</p>

<p>"It's Robin Greenlaw," said Alexander, "from
Littlefarm.&mdash;You've been to the wedding, Robin?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Janet's some kind of a cousin. It's a braw
day for a wedding! You've got with you the new
laird's nephew?&mdash;And how are you liking Black Hill?"</p>

<p>"I like it."</p>

<p>"I suppose you miss grandeurs abune what ye've
got there. I have a liking myself," said Greenlaw,
"for grandeurs, though we've none at all at Littlefarm!
That is to say, none that's just obvious. Are
you going to White Farm?"</p>

<p>Alexander answered: "I've a message from my
father for Mr. Barrow. But after that we're going
through the glen. Will you come along?"</p>

<p>"I would," said Greenlaw, seriously, "if I had
not on my best. But I know how you, Alexander
Jardine, take the devil's counsel about setting foot
in places bad for good clothes! So I'll give myself
the pleasure some other time. And so good day!"
He turned into a path that took him presently out
of sight and sound.</p>

<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>"He's a fine one!" said Alexander. "I like him."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"White Farm's great-nephew. Littlefarm was
parted from White Farm. It's over yonder where
you see the water shining."</p>

<p>"He's free-mannered enough!"</p>

<p>"That's you and England! He's got as good a
pedigree as any, and a notion of what's a man,
besides. He's been to Glasgow to school, too. I
like folk like that."</p>

<p>"I like them as well as you!" said Ian. "That is,
with reservations of them I cannot like. I'm Scots,
too."</p>

<p>Alexander laughed. They came down to the
water and the stepping-stones before White Farm.
The house faced them, long and low, white among
trees from which the leaves were falling. Alexander
and Ian crossed upon the stones, and beyond the
fringing hazels the dogs came to meet them.</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow had all the appearance of a figure
from that Old Testament in which he was learned.
He might have been a prophet's right-hand man,
he might have been the prophet himself. He stood,
at sixty-five, lean and strong, gray-haired, but with
decrepitude far away. Elder of the kirk, sternly
religious, able at his own affairs, he read his Bible
and prospered in his earthly living. Now he listened
to the laird's message, nodding his head, but
saying little. His staff was in his hand; he was on
his way to kirk session; tell the laird that the account
was correct. He stood without his door as
though he waited for the youths to give good day
and depart. Alexander had made a movement in
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>this direction when from beyond Jarvis Barrow came
a woman's voice. It belonged to Jenny Barrow,
the farmer's unmarried daughter, who kept house
for him.</p>

<p>"Father, do you gae on, and let the young gentlemen
bide a wee and rest their banes and tell a puir
woman wha never gaes onywhere the news!"</p>

<p>"Then do ye sit awhile, laddies, with the womenfolk,"
said Jarvis Barrow. "But give me pardon
if I go, for I canna keep the kirk waiting."</p>

<p>He was gone, staff and gray plaid and a collie
with him. Jenny, his daughter, appeared in the
door.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Alexander, and you, too, sir, and
have a crack with us! We're in the dairy-room,
Elspeth and Gilian and me."</p>

<p>She was a woman of forty, raw-boned but not unhandsome,
good-natured, capable, too, but with
more heart than head. It was a saying with her
that she had brains enough for kirk on the Sabbath
and a warm house the week round. Everybody
knew Jenny Barrow and liked well enough bread
of her baking.</p>

<p>The room to which she led Ian and Alexander had
its floor level with the turf without the open door.
The sun flooded it. There came from within the
sound, up and down, of a churn, and a voice singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O laddie, will ye gie to me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A ribbon for my fairing?"<br /></span>
</div></div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>It grew that Ian was telling stories of cities&mdash;of
London and of Paris, for he had been there, and
of Rome, for he had been there. He had seen kings
and queens, he had seen the Pope&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord save us!" ejaculated Jenny Barrow.</p>

<p>He leaned against the dairy wall and the sun fell
over him, and he looked something finer and more
golden than often came that way. Young Gilian
at the churn stood with parted lips, the long dasher
still in her hands. This was as good as stories of
elves, pixies, fays, men of peace and all! Elspeth
let the milk-pans be and sat beside them on the
long bench, and, with hands folded in her lap,
looked with brown eyes many a league away.
Neither Elspeth nor Gilian was without book
learning. Behind them and before them were long
visits to scholar kindred in a city in the north
and fit schooling there. London and Paris and
Rome.... Foreign lands and the great world.
And this was a glittering young eagle that had
sailed and seen!</p>

<p>Alexander gazed with delight upon Ian spreading
triumphant wings. This was his friend. There
was nothing finer than continuously to come upon
praiseworthiness in your friend!</p>

<p><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>"And a beautiful lady came by who was the king's
favorite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gude guide us! The limmer!"</p>

<p>"And she was walking on rose-colored velvet and
her slippers had diamonds worked in them. Snow
was on the ground outside and poor folk were freezing,
but she carried over each arm a garland of roses
as though it were June&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jenny Barrow raised her hands. "She'll sit yet in
the cauld blast, in the sinner's shift!"</p>

<p>"And after a time there walked in the king, and
the courtiers behind him like the tail of a peacock&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had a happy hour in the White Farm dairy.
At last Jenny and the girls set for the two cold meat
and bannocks and ale. And still at table Ian was the
shining one. The sun was at noon and so was his
mood.</p>

<p>"You're fey!" said Alexander, at last.</p>

<p>"Na, na!" spoke Jenny. "But, oh, he's the bonny
lad!"</p>

<p>The dinner was eaten. It was time to be going.</p>

<p>"Shut your book of stories!" said Alexander.
"We're for the Kelpie's Pool, and that's not just a
step from here!"</p>

<p>Elspeth raised her brown eyes. "Why will you
go to the Kelpie's Pool? That's a drear water!"</p>

<p>"I want to show it to him. He's never seen it."</p>

<p>"It's drear!" said Elspeth. "A drear, wanrestfu'
place!"</p>

<p>But Ian and Alexander must go. The aunt and
nieces accompanied them to the door, stood and
watched them forth, down the bank and into the
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>path that ran to the glen. Looking back, the youths
saw them there&mdash;Elspeth and Gilian and their aunt
Jenny. Then the aspens came between and hid them
and the white house and all.</p>

<p>"They're bonny lasses!" said Ian.</p>

<p>"Aye. They're so."</p>

<p>"But, oh, man! you should see Miss Delafield of
Tower Place in Surrey!"</p>

<p>"Is she so bonny?"</p>

<p>"She's more than bonny. She's beautiful and high-born
and an heiress. When I'm a colonel of dragoons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you going to be a colonel of dragoons?"</p>

<p>"Something like that. You talk of thinking that
you were this and that in the past. Well, I was a
fighting-man!"</p>

<p>"We're all fighting-men. It's only what we fight
and how."</p>

<p>"Well, say that I had been a chief, and they lifted
me on their shields and called me king, the very next
day I should have made her queen!"</p>

<p>"You think like a ballad. And, oh, man, you talk
mickle of the lasses!"</p>

<p>Ian looked at him with long, narrow, dark-gold
eyes. "They're found in ballads," he said.</p>

<p>Alexander just paused in his stride. "Humph!
that's true!..."</p>

<p>They entered the glen. The stream began to
brawl; on either hand the hills closed in, towering
high. Some of the trees were bare, but to most yet
clung the red-brown or the gold-brown dress. The
pines showed hard, green, and dead in the shadow;
in the sunlight, fine, green-gold, and alive. The
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>fallen leaves, moved by foot or by breeze, made a
light, dry, talking sound. The white birch stems
clustered and leaned; patches of bright-green moss
ran between the drifts of leaves. The sides of the hills
came close together, grew fearfully steep. Crags
appeared, and fern-crowded fissures and roots of
trees like knots of frozen serpents. The glen narrowed
and deepened; the water sang with a loud,
rough voice.</p>

<p>Alexander loved this place. He had known it in
childhood, often straying this way with the laird,
or with Sandy the shepherd, or Davie from the
house. When he was older he began to come alone.
Soon he came often alone, learned every stick and
stone and contour, effect of light and streak of gloom.
As idle or as purposeful as the wind, he knew the
glen from top to bottom. He knew the voice of the
stream and the straining clutch of the roots over the
broken crag. He had lain on all the beds of leaf and
moss, and talked with every creeping or flying or
running thing. Sometimes he read a book here, sometimes
he pictured the world, or built fantastic stages,
and among fantastic others acted himself a fantastic
part. Sometimes with a blind turning within he
looked for himself. He had his own thoughts of
God here, of God and the Kirk and the devil. Often,
too, he neither read, dreamed, nor thought. He might
lie an hour, still, passive, receptive. The trees and
the clouds, crag life, bird life, and flower life, life of
water, earth, and air, came inside. He was so used
to his own silence in the glen that when he walked
through it with others he kept it still. Slightly taciturn
everywhere, he was actively so here. The path
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>narrowing, he and Ian must go in single file. Leading,
Alexander traveled in silence, and Ian, behind, not
familiar with the place, must mind his steps, and so
fell silent, too. Here and there, now and then,
Alexander halted. These were recesses, or it might
be projecting platforms of rock, that he liked. Below,
the stream made still pools, or moved in eddies, or
leaped with an innumerable hurrying noise from
level to level. Or again there held a reach of quiet
water, and the glen-sides were soft with weeping birch,
and there showed a wider arch of still blue sky.
Alexander stood and looked. Ian, behind him, was
glad of the pause. The place dizzied him who for
years had been away from hill and mountain, pass
and torrent. Yet he would by no means tell Alexander
so. He would keep up with him.</p>

<p>There was a mile of this glen, and now the going
was worse and now it was better. Three-fourths of
the way through they came to an opening in the
rock, over which, from a shelf above, fell a curtain
of brier.</p>

<p>"See!" said Alexander, and, parting the stems,
showed a veritable cavern. "Come in&mdash;sit down!
The Kelpie's Pool is out of the glen, but they say
that there's a bogle wons here, too."</p>

<p>They sat down upon the rocky floor strewn with
dead leaves. Through the dropped curtain they saw
the world brokenly; the light in the cave was sunken
and dim, the air cold. Ian drew his shoulders together.</p>

<p>"Here's a grand place for robbers, wraiths, or
dragons!"</p>

<p>"Robbers, wraiths, or dragons, or just quiet dead
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>leaves and ourselves. Look here&mdash;!" He showed
a heap of short fagots in a corner. "I put these
here the last time I came." Dragging them into
the middle of the rock chamber, he swept up with
them the dead leaves, then took from a great
pouch that he carried on his rambles a box with
flint and steel. He struck a spark upon dry moss
and in a moment had a fire. "Is not that beautiful?"</p>

<p>The smoke mounted to the top of the cavern,
curled there or passed out into the glen through
the briers that dropped like a portcullis. The fagots
crackled in the flame, the light danced, the warmth
was pleasant. So was the sense of adventure and
of <i>solitude &agrave; deux</i>. They stretched themselves beside
the flame. Alexander produced from his pouch
four small red-cheeked apples. They ate and talked,
with between their words silences of deep content.
They were two comrade hunters of long ago, cavemen
who had dispossessed bear or wolf, who might
presently with a sharpened bone and some red
pigment draw bison and deer in procession upon the
cave wall.&mdash;They were skin-clad hillmen, shag-haired,
with strange, rude weapons, in hiding here
after hard fighting with a disciplined, conquering foe
who had swords and shining breastplates and crested
helmets.&mdash;They were fellow-soldiers of that conquering
tide, Romans of a band that kept the Wall,
proud, with talk of camps and C&aelig;sars.&mdash;They were
knights of Arthur's table sent by Merlin on some
magic quest.&mdash;They were Crusaders, and this cavern
an Eastern, desert cave.&mdash;They were men who
rose with Wallace, must hide in caves from Edward
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>Longshanks.&mdash;They were outlaws.&mdash;They were wizards&mdash;good
wizards who caused flowers to bloom in
winter for the unhappy, and made gold here for
those who must be ransomed, and fed themselves
with secret bread. The fire roared&mdash;they were
happy, Ian and Alexander.</p>

<p>At last the fagots were burned out. The half-murk
that at first was mystery and enchantment
began to put on somberness and melancholy. They
rose from the rocky floor and extinguished the
brands with their feet. But now they had this
cavern in common and must arrange it for their
next coming. Going outside, they gathered dead
and fallen wood, broke it into right lengths, and,
carrying it within, heaped it in the corner. With a
bough of pine they swept the floor, then, leaving
the treasure hold, dropped the curtain of brier in
place. They were not so old but that there was
yet the young boy in them; he hugged himself over
this cave of Robin Hood and swart magician. But
now they left it and went on whistling through the
glen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gie ye give ane, then I'll give twa,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For sae the store increases!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sides of the glen fell back, grew lower. The
leap of the water was not so marked; there were
long pools of quiet. Their path had been a mounting
one; they were now on higher earth, near the
plateau or watershed that marked the top of the
glen. The bright sky arched overhead, the sun
shone strongly, the air moved in currents without
violence.</p>

<p><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>"You see where that smoke comes up between
trees? That's Mother Binning's cot."</p>

<p>"Who's she?"</p>

<p>"She's a wise auld wife. She's a scryer. That's
her ash-tree."</p>

<p>Their path brought them by the hut and its bit
of garden. Jock Binning, that was Mother Binning's
crippled son, sat fishing in the stream. Mother
Binning had been working in the garden, but when
she saw the figures on the path below she took her
distaff and sat on the bench in the sun. When they
came by she raised her voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alexander, how are the laird and the leddy?"</p>

<p>"They're very well, Mother."</p>

<p>"Ye'll be gaeing sune to Edinburgh? Wha may
be this laddie?"</p>

<p>"It is Ian Rullock, of Black Hill."</p>

<p>"Sae the baith o' ye are gaeing to Edinburgh?
Will ye be friends there?"</p>

<p>"That we will!"</p>

<p>"Hech, sirs!" Mother Binning drew a thread
from her distaff. The two were about to travel on
when she stopped them again with a gesture.
"Dinna mak sic haste! There's time enough behind
us, and time enough before us. And it's a strange
warld, and a large, and an auld! Sit ye and crack
a bit with an auld wife by the road."</p>

<p>But they had dallied at White Farm and in the
cave, and Alexander was in haste.</p>

<p>"We cannot stop now, Mother. We're bound for
the Kelpie's Pool."</p>

<p>"And why do ye gae there? That's a drear, wanrestfu'
place!" said Mother Binning.</p>

<p><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>"Ian has not seen it yet. I want to show it to
him."</p>

<p>Mother Binning turned her distaff slowly. "Eh,
then, if ye maun gae, gae!... We're a' ane! There's
the kelpie pool for a'."</p>

<p>"We'll stop a bit on the way back," said Alexander.
He spoke in a wheedling, kindly voice, for
he and Mother Binning were good friends.</p>

<p>"Do that then," she said. "I hae a hansel o'
coffee by me. I'll mak twa cups, for I'll warrant
that ye'll baith need it!"</p>

<p>The air was indeed growing colder when the two
came at last upon the moor that ran down to the
Kelpie's Pool. Furze and moss and ling, a wild
country stretched around without trees or house or
moving form. The bare sunshine took on a remote,
a cool and foreign, aspect. The small singing of
the wind in whin and heather came from a thin,
eery world. Down below them they saw the dark
little tarn, the Kelpie's Pool. It was very clear,
but dark, with a bottom of peat. Around it grew
rushes and a few low willows. The two sat upon an
outcropping of stone and gazed down upon it.</p>

<p>"It's a gey lonely place," said Alexander. "Now
I like it as well or better than I do the cave, and
now I would leave it far behind me!"</p>

<p>"I like the cave best. This is a creepy place."</p>

<p>"Once I let myself out at Glenfernie without any
knowing and came here by night."</p>

<p>Ian felt emulation. "Oh, I would do that, too,
if there was any need! Did you see anything?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the kelpie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>"No. I saw something&mdash;once. But that time I
wanted to see how the stars looked in the water."</p>

<p>Ian looked at the water, that lay like a round
mirror, and then to the vast shell of the sky above.
He, too, had love of beauty&mdash;a more sensuous love
than Alexander's, but love. This shared perception
made one of the bonds between them.</p>

<p>"It was as still&mdash;much stiller than it is to-day!
The air was clear and the night dark and grand.
I looked down, and there was the Northern Crown,
clasp and all."</p>

<p>Ian in imagination saw it, too. They sat, chin
on knees, upon the moorside above the Kelpie's
Pool. The water was faintly crisped, the reeds and
willow boughs just stirred.</p>

<p>"But the kelpie&mdash;did you ever see that?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes it is seen as a water-horse, sometimes
as a demon. I never saw anything like that but
once. I never told any one about it. It may have
been just one of those willows, after all. But I
thought I saw a woman."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"There was a great mist that day and it was hard
to see. Sometimes you could not see&mdash;it was just
rolling waves of gray. So I stumbled down, and I
was in the rushes before I knew that I had come to
them. It was spring and the pool was full, and the
water plashed and came over my foot. It was like
something holding my ankles.... And then I saw
her&mdash;if it was not the willow. She was like a fair
woman with dark hair unsnooded. She looked at
me as though she would mock me, and I thought
she laughed&mdash;and then the mist rolled down and
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>over, and I could not see the hills nor the water nor
scarce the reeds I was in. So I lifted my feet from
the sucking water and got away.... I do not know
if it was the kelpie's daughter or the willow&mdash;but if
it was the willow it could look like a human&mdash;or
an unhuman&mdash;body!"</p>

<p>Ian gazed at the pool. He had many advantages
over Alexander, he knew, but the latter had
this curious daring. He did more things with himself
and of himself than did he, Ian. There was
that in Ian that did not like this, that was jealous
of being surpassed. And there was that in Ian
that would not directly display this feeling, that
would provide it, indeed, with all kinds of masks,
but would, with certainty, act from that spurring,
though intricate enough might be the path between
the stimulus and the act.</p>

<p>"It is deep?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Almost bottomless, you would think, and
cold as winter."</p>

<p>"Let us go swimming."</p>

<p>"The day's getting late and it's growing cold.
However, if you want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ian did not greatly want to. But if Alexander
could be so indifferent, he could be determined and
ardent. "What's a little mirk and cold? I want
to say I've swum in it." He began to unbutton
his waistcoat.</p>

<p>They stripped, left their clothes in the stone's
keeping, and ran down the moorside. The light
played over their bodies, unblemished, smooth, and
healthfully colored, clean-lined and rightly spare.
They had beautiful postures and movements when
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>they stood, when they ran; a youthful and austere
grace as of Spartan youth plunging down to the
icy Eurotas. The earth around lay as stripped as
they; the naked, ineffable blue ether held them as
it did all things; the wandering air broke against
them in invisible surf. They ran down the long
slope of the moor, parted the reeds, and dived to
meet their own reflections. The water was most
truly deep and cold. They struck out, they swam
to the middle of the pool, they turned upon their
backs and looked up to the blue zenith, then, turning
again, with strong arm strokes they sent the
wave over each other. They rounded the pool
under the twisted willows, beside the shaking reeds;
they swam across and across.</p>

<p>Alexander looked at the sun that was deep in the
western quarter. "Time to be out and going!" He
swam to the edge of the pool, but before he should
draw himself out stopped to look up at a willow above
him, the one that he thought he might, in the mist,
have taken for the kelpie's daughter. It was of a
height that, seen at a little distance, might even a tall
woman. It put out two broken, shortened branches
like arms.... He lost himself in the study of possibilities,
balanced among the reeds that sighed around.
He could not decide, so at last he shook himself from
that consideration, and, pushing into shallow water,
stepped from the pool. He had taken a few steps
up the moor ere with suddenness he felt that Ian
was not with him. He turned. Ian was yet out in
the middle ring of the tarn. The light struck upon
his head. Then he dived under&mdash;or seemed to dive
under. He was long in coming up; and when he
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>did so it was in the same place and his backward-drawn
face had a strangeness.</p>

<p>"Ian!"</p>

<p>Ian sank again.</p>

<p>"He's crampit!" Alexander flashed like a thrown
brand down the way he had mounted and across the
strip of weeds, and in again to the steel-dark water.
"I'm coming!" He gained to his fellow, caught him
ere he sank the third time.</p>

<p>Dragged from the Kelpie's Pool, Ian lay upon the
moor. Alexander, bringing with haste the clothes
from the stone above, knelt beside him, rubbed
and kneaded the life into him. He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Alexander&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Alexander rubbed with vigor. "I'm here. Eh,
lad, but you gave me a fright!"</p>

<p>In another five minutes he sat up. "I'm&mdash;I'm all
right now. Let's get our things on and go."</p>

<p>They dressed, Alexander helping Ian. The blood
came slowly back into the latter's cheek; he walked,
but he shivered yet.</p>

<p>"Let's go get Mother Binning's coffee!" said
Alexander. "Come, I'll put my arm about you so."
They went thus up the moor and across, and then
down to the trees, the stream, and the glen. "There's
the smoke from her chimney! You may have both
cups and lie by the fire till you're warm. Mercy me!
how lonely the cave would have been if you had
drowned!"</p>

<p>They got down to the flowing water.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now!" said Ian. He released himself,
but before he did so he turned in Alexander's
arm, put his own arm around the other's neck, and
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>kissed him. "You saved my life. Let's be friends
forever!"</p>

<p>"That's what we are," said Alexander, "friends
forever."</p>

<p>"You've proved it to me; one day I'll prove it
to you!"</p>

<p>"We don't need proofs. We just know that we
like each other, and that's all there is about it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's that way," said Ian, and so they came
to Mother Binning's cot, the fire, and the coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>Upon a quiet, gray December afternoon, nine
years and more from the June day when he
had fished in the glen and Mother Binning had told
him of her vision of the Jacobite gathering at Braemar,
English Strickland, walking for exercise to the
village and back, found himself overtaken by Mr.
M'Nab, the minister who in his white manse dwelt by
the white kirk on the top of the windy hill. This
was, by every earthly canon, a good man, but a stern
and unsupple. He had not been long in this parish,
and he was sweeping with a strong, new besom.
The old minister, to his mind, had been Erastian and
lax, weak in doctrine and in discipline of the fold.
Mr. M'Nab meant not to be weak. He loathed sin
and would compel the sinner also to loathe it. Now
he came up, tall and darkly clad, and in his Calvinistic
hand his Bible.</p>

<p>"Gude day, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. M'Nab!" The two went on side
by side. The day was very still, the sky an even
gray, snow being prepared. "You saw the laird?"</p>

<p>"Aye. He's verra low."</p>

<p>"He'll not recover I think. It's been a slow
failing for two years&mdash;ever since Mrs. Jardine's
death."</p>

<p><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>"She was dead before I came to this kirk. But
once, when I was a young man, I stayed awhile in
these parts. I remember her."</p>

<p>"She was the best of women."</p>

<p>"So they said. But she had not that grip upon
religion that the laird has!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not."</p>

<p>Mr. M'Nab directed his glance upon the Glenfernie
tutor. He did not think that this Englishman,
either, had much grip upon religion. He
determined, at the first opportunity, to call his
attention to that fact and to strive to teach his
fingers how to clasp. He had a craving thirst for
the saving of souls, and to draw one whole from
Laodicea was next best to lifting from Babylon.
But to-day the laird and his spiritual concerns had
the field.</p>

<p>"He comes, by the mother's side, at least, of godly
stock. His mother's father was martyred for the
faith in the auld persecuting time. His grandmother
wearied her mind away in prison. His
mother suffered much when she was a lassie."</p>

<p>"It's small wonder that he has nursed bitterness,"
said Strickland. "He must have drunk in
terror and hate with her milk.... He conquered the
terror."</p>

<p>"<i>'Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and
am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my
enemies.'</i>&mdash;What else should his heart do but burn
with a righteous wrath?"</p>

<p>Strickland sighed, looking at the quiet gray hills
and the vast, still web of cloud above. "It's come
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>to be a withering fire, hunting fuel everywhere! I
remember when he held it in bounds, even when for
a time it seemed to die out. But of late years it
has got the better of him. At last, I think, it is
devouring himself."</p>

<p>M'Nab made a dissenting sound. "He has got
the implicit belief in God that I see sair lack of elsewhere!
He holds fast to God."</p>

<p>"Aye. The God who slays the Amalekites."</p>

<p>M'Nab turned his wintry glance upon him.
"And is not that God?"</p>

<p>The other looked at the hill and at the vast, quiet,
gray field of cloud. "Perhaps!... Let's talk of
something else. I am too tired to argue. I sat
up with him last night."</p>

<p>The minister would have preferred to continue
to discuss the character of Deity. He turned
heavily. "I was in company, not long ago, with
some gentlemen who were wondering why you
stayed on at Glenfernie House. They said that
you had good offers elsewhere&mdash;much better than
with a Scots laird."</p>

<p>"I promised Mrs. Jardine that I would stay."</p>

<p>"While the laird lived?"</p>

<p>"No, not just that&mdash;though I think that she
would have liked me to do so. But so long as the
laird would keep Jamie with him at home."</p>

<p>"What will he do now&mdash;Jamie?"</p>

<p>"He has set his heart on the army. He's strong
of body, with a kind of big, happy-go-luckiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>A horseman came up behind them. It proved
to be Robin Greenlaw, of Littlefarm. He checked
his gray and exchanged greetings with the minister
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>and the tutor. "How does the laird find himself
the day?" he asked Strickland.</p>

<p>"No better, I think, Mr. Greenlaw."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. It's the end, I jalouse! Is Mr.
Alexander come?"</p>

<p>"We look for him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"The land and the folk'll be blithe to see him&mdash;if
it was not for the occasion of his coming! If
there's aught a body can do for any at Glenfernie&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Every one has been as good as gold, Greenlaw.
But you know there's not much at the last that can
be done&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. We all pass, and they that bide can but
make the dirge. But I'll be obliged if you'll say
to Mr. Alexander that if there <i>is</i> aught&mdash;" He
gathered up the reins. "It will be snowing presently.
I always thought that I'd like to part on a
day like this, gray and quiet, with all the color and
the shouting lifted elsewhere." He was gone,
trotting before them on his big horse.</p>

<p>Strickland and the minister looked after him.
"There's one to be liked no little!" said Strickland.</p>

<p>But Mr. M'Nab's answering tone was wintry yet.
"He makes mair songs than he listens to sermons!
Jarvis Barrow, that's a strong witness, should have
had another sort of great-nephew! And so he that
will be laird comes home to-morrow? It's little that
he has been at home of late years."</p>

<p>"Yes, little."</p>

<p>The manse with the kirk beyond rose before them,
drawn against the pallid sky. "A wanderer to and
fro in the earth, and I doubt not&mdash;though we do not
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>hear much of it&mdash;an eater of husks!&mdash;Will you not
come in, Mr. Strickland?"</p>

<p>"Another time, Mr. M'Nab. I've an errand in the
village.&mdash;Touching Alexander Jardine. I suppose
that the whole sense-bound world might be called by
a world farther on an eater of husks. But I know
naught to justify any especial application of the
phrase to him. I know, indeed, a good deal quite to
the contrary. You are, it seems to me, something
less than charitable&mdash;"</p>

<p>M'Nab regarded him with an earnest, narrow,
wintry look. "I would not wish to deserve that epithet,
Mr. Strickland. But the world is evil, and Satan
stands close at the ear of the young, both the poor
and them of place and world's gear! So I doubt not
that he eats the husks. I doubt not, either, that the
Lord has a rod for him, as for us all, that will drive
him, willy-nilly, home. So I'll say good day, sir.
To-morrow I'll go again to the laird, and so every
day until his summons comes."</p>

<p>They parted at the manse door. The world was
gray, the snow swiftening its approach. Strickland,
passing the kirk, kept on down the one village street.
All and any who were out of doors spoke to him,
asking how did the laird. Some asked if "the young
laird" had come.</p>

<p>In the shop where he made his purchase the woman
who sold would have kept him talking an hour:
"Wad the laird last the week? Wad he make friends
before he died with Mr. Touris of Black Hill with
whom he had the great quarrel three years since?
Eh, sirs! and he never set foot again in Touris House,
nor Mr. Touris in his!&mdash;Wad Mr. Jamie gae now to
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>Edinburgh or on his travels, that had been at home
sae lang because the laird wadna part with him?&mdash;Wad
Miss Alice, that was as bonny as a rose and
mair friendly than the gowans on a June lea, just
bide on at the house with her aunt, Mrs. Grizel, that
came when the leddy died? Wad&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strickland smiled. "You must just come up to the
house, Mrs. Macmurdo, and have a talk with Mrs.
Grizel.&mdash;I hope the laird may last the week."</p>

<p>"You're a close ane!" thought the disappointed
Mrs. Macmurdo. Aloud she said, "Aweel, sir, Mr.
Alexander that will be laird is coming hame frae foreign
parts?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sic a wanderer as he has been! But there!"
said Mrs. Macmurdo, "ony that saw him when he
was a laddie gaeing here and gaeing there by his lane-some,
glen and brae and muir, might ha' said,
'Ye're a wanderer&mdash;and as sune as ye may ye'll
wander farther!'"</p>

<p>"You're quite right, Mrs. Macmurdo," said
Strickland, and took his parcel from her.</p>

<p>"A wanderer and a seeker!" Mrs. Macmurdo was
loth to let him go. "And his great friend is still
Captain Ian Rullock?"</p>

<p>"Yes, still."</p>

<p>Mrs. Macmurdo reluctantly opened the shop door.
"Aweel, sir, if ye maun gae.&mdash;There'll be snaw the
night, I'm thinking! Do ye stop at the inn? There's
twa-three sogers in town."</p>

<p>Strickland had not meant to stop. But, coming to
the Jardine Arms and glancing through the window,
he saw by the light of the fire in the common room
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>four men in red coats sitting at table, drinking. He
felt jaded and depressed, needing distraction from
the gray chill day and the laird's dying. Curiosity
faintly stretched herself. He turned into the inn,
took a seat by a corner table, and called for a bottle
of wine. In addition to the soldiers the room had a
handful of others&mdash;farmers, a lawyer's clerk from
Stirling, a petty officer of the excise, and two or three
village nondescripts. From this group there now disengaged
himself Robin Greenlaw, who came across to
Strickland's table.</p>

<p>"Sit down and have a glass with me," said the
latter. "Who are they?"</p>

<p>"A recruiting party," answered Greenlaw, accepting
the invitation. "I like to hear their talk! I'll
listen, drinking your wine and thanking you, sir!
and riding home I'll make a song about them."</p>

<p>He sat with his arm over the chair-back, his right
hand now lifting and now lowering the wine-glass.
He had a look of strength and inner pleasure that
rested and refreshed.</p>

<p>"What are they saying now?" asked Strickland.</p>

<p>The soldiers made the center of attention. More
or less all in the room harkened to their talk, disconnected,
obscure, idle, and boisterous as much of it
was. The revenue officer, by virtue of being also the
king's paid man, had claimed comrade's right and
was drinking with them and putting questions. He
was so obliging as to ask these in a round tone of
voice and to repeat on the same note the information
gathered.</p>

<p>"Recruits for the King's army, fighting King Louis
on the river Main.&mdash;Where's that?&mdash;It's in Germany.
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>Our King and the Hanoverians and the King of
Prussia and the Queen of Austria are fighting the
King of France.&mdash;Aye, of course ye know that, neighbors,
being intelligent Scots folk, but recapitulation
is na out of order!"</p>

<p>"Ask them what's thought of the Hanoverians."
It was the lawyer's clerk's question. Thereupon rose
some noisy difference of opinion among the drinking
redcoats. The excise man finally reported. "They're
na English, nor Scots, nor even Irish. But they're
liked weel enough! They're good fighters. Oh, aye,
when ye march and fight alangside them, they're
good enough! They're his Majesty's cousins. God
save King George!"</p>

<p>The recruiting party banged with tankards upon
the table. One of the number put a question of his
own. He had a look half pedant, half bully, and he
spoke with a one-quarter-drunken, owllike solemnity.</p>

<p>"I may take it from the look of things that there
are none hereabouts but good Whigs and upholders
of government? No Tories&mdash;no damned black
Jacobites?"</p>

<p>The excise man hemmed. "Why, ye see we're no
sae muckle far from Hielands and Hielandmen, and
it's known what they are, chief, chieftain, and clan&mdash;saving
always the duke and every Campbell! And
I wadna say that there are not, here and there, this
side the Hielands, an auld family with leanings the
auld way, and even a few gentlemen who were <i>out</i>
in the 'fifteen. But the maist of us, gentle and simple,
are up and down Whig and Kirk and reigning House.&mdash;Na,
na! when we drink to the King we dinna pass
the glass over the water!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>A dark, thin soldier put in his word, well garnished
with oaths. "Now that there's war up and
down and so many of us are going out of the country,
there's a saying that the Pretender may e'en sail
across from France and beat a drum and give a
shout! Then there'll be a sorting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Them that would rise wouldn't be enough to make
a graveyard ghost to frighten with!"</p>

<p>"You're mistaken there. They'll frighten ye all
right when they answer the drum! I'm thinking
there's some in the army would answer it!"</p>

<p>"Then they'll be hanged, drawn, and quartered!"
averred the corporal. "Who are ye thinking would
do that?"</p>

<p>"I'm not precisely knowing. But there are some
with King George were brought up on the hope of
King James!"</p>

<p>More liquor appeared upon the table, was poured
and drunk. The talk grew professional. The King's
shilling, and the advantage of taking it, came solely
upon the board, and who might or might not 'list
from this dale and the bordering hills. Strickland
and Robin Greenlaw left their corner.</p>

<p>"I must get back to the house."</p>

<p>"And I to Littlefarm."</p>

<p>They went out together. There were few in the
street. The snow was beginning to fall. Greenlaw
untied his horse.</p>

<p>"I hope that we're not facing another 'fifteen!
<i>'Scotland's ain Stewarts, and Break the Union!'</i> It
sounds well, but it's not in the line of progression.
What does Captain Ian Rullock think
about it?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>"I don't know. He hasn't been here, you know, for
a long while."</p>

<p>"That's true. He and Mr. Alexander are still like
brothers?"</p>

<p>"Like brothers."</p>

<p>Greenlaw mounted his horse. "Well, he's a bonny
man, but he's got a piece of the demon in him! So
have I, I ken very well, and so, doubtless, has he who
will be Glenfernie, and all the rest of us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I sit down to supper with mine very often,"
said Strickland.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he's common&mdash;the demon! But somehow
I could find him in Ian Rullock, though all
covered up with gold. But doubtless," said Greenlaw,
debonairly, "it would be the much of the fellow
in me that would recognize much in another!" He
put his gray into motion. "Good day, sir!" He was
gone, disappearing down the long street, into the
snow that was now falling like a veil.</p>

<p>Strickland turned homeward. The snow fell fast
and thick in large white flakes. Glenfernie House
rose before him, crowning the craggy hill, the modern
building and the remnant of the old castle, not a
great place, but an ancient, settled, and rooted, part
of a land poor but not without grandeur, not without
a rhythm attained between grandeur and homeliness.
The road swept around and up between leafless
trees and green cone-bearing ones. The snow was
whitening the branches, the snow wrapped house and
landscape in its veil. It broke, in part it obliterated,
line and modeling; the whole seemed on the point of
dissolving into a vast and silent unity. "Like a dying
man," thought Strickland. He came upon the
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>narrow level space about the house, passed the great
cedar planted by a pilgrim laird the year of Flodden
Field, and entered by a door in the southern face.</p>

<p>Davie met him. "Eh, sir, Mr. Alexander's
come!"</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>"Aye, just! An hour past, riding Black Alan,
with Tam Dickson behind on Whitefoot, and weary
enough thae horses looked! Mr. Alexander wad ha'
gane without bite or sup to the laird's room, but he's
lying asleep. So now he's gane to his ain auld room
for a bit of rest. Haith, sir," said Davie, "but he's
like the auld laird when he was twenty-eight!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Strickland went, to the hall, where he found
Alice.</p>

<p>"Come to the fire! I've been watching the snow,
but it is so white and thick and still it fair frightens
me! Davie told you that Alexander has come?"</p>

<p>"Yes. From Edinburgh to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes. He left London as soon as he had our
letters."</p>

<p>She stood opposite him, a bright and bonny lass,
with a look of her mother, but with more beauty.
The light from the burning logs deepened the gold
in her hair, as the warmth made more vivid the rose
of her cheek. She owned a warm and laughing
heart, a natural goodness. Strickland, who had
watched and taught her since she was a slip of a
child, had for her a great fondness.</p>

<p>Jamie entered the hall. "Father's awake now,
but Aunt Grizel and Tibbie Ross will not tell him
Alexander's come until they've given him something
to eat." He came to the fire and stood, his
blue eyes glinting light. "It's fine to see Alexander!
The whole place feels different!"</p>

<p>"You've got a fine love for Alexander," said
Strickland. So long had he lived with the Jardines
of Glenfernie that they had grown like own folk
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>to him, and he to them. He looked very kindly at
the young man, handsome, big, flushed with feeling.
He did not say, "Now you'll be going, Jamie,
and he'll be staying," but the thought was in mind,
and presently Alice gave it voice.</p>

<p>"He says that he has seen his earth, and that
now he means to be a long time at home."</p>

<p>Davie appeared. "Mr. Alexander has gone to the
laird's room. Mrs. Grizel wad have ye all come, too,
sae be ye move saftly and sit dumb."</p>

<p>The three went. The laird's room was large and
somewhat grimly bare. When his wife died he
would have taken out every luxury. But a great
fire burned on the hearth and gave a touch of redemption.
A couch, too, had been brought in for
the watcher at night, and a great flowered chair.
In this now sat Mrs. Grizel Kerr, a pleasant, elderly,
comely body, noted for her housewifery and her garden
of herbs. Behind her, out of a shadowy corner,
gleamed the white mutch of Tibbie Ross, the
best nurse in that countryside. Jamie and Alice
took two chairs that had been set for them near the
bed. Strickland moved to the recess of a window.
Outside the snow fell in very large flakes, large and
many, straight and steady, there being no wind.</p>

<p>In a chair drawn close to the great bed, on a line
with the sick man's hand lying on the coverlet, sat
the heir of Glenfernie. He sat leaning forward, with
one hand near the hand of his father. The laird's
eyes were closed. He had been given a stimulant
and he now lay gathering his powers that were not
far from this life's frontier. The curtains of the bed
had been drawn quite back; propped by pillows into
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>a half-sitting posture, he was plain to all in the room,
in the ruddy light of the fire. A clock upon the wall
ticked, ticked. Those in the room sat very still.</p>

<p>The laird drew a determined breath and opened
his eyes. "Alexander!"</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>"You look like myself sitting there, and yet not
myself. I am going to die."</p>

<p>"If that's your will, father."</p>

<p>"Aye, it's my will, for I've made it mine. I
can't talk much. We'll talk at times and sit still
between. Are you going to stay with me to-night?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am, father. Right here beside you."</p>

<p>"Well, I've missed you. But you had to have
your wanderings and your life of men. I understood
that."</p>

<p>"You've been most good to me. It is in my heart
and in the tears of my eyes."</p>

<p>"I did not grudge the siller. And I've had a
pride in you, Alexander. Now you'll be the laird.
Now let's sit quiet a bit."</p>

<p>The snow fell, the fire burned, the clock ticked.
He spoke again. "It's before an eye inside that
you'll be a wanderer and a goer about yet&mdash;within
and without, my laddie, within and without! Do
not forget, though, to hold the old place together
that so many Jardines have been born in, and to
care for the tenant bodies and the old folk&mdash;and
there's your brother and sister."</p>

<p>"I will forget nothing that you say, father."</p>

<p>"I have kept that to say on top of my mind....
The old place and the tenant bodies and old folk,
and your brother and sister. I have your word,
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>and so," said the laird, "that's done and may drift
by.&mdash;Grizel, I wad sleep a bit. Let him go and
come again."</p>

<p>His eyes closed. Alexander rose from the chair
beside him. Coming to Alice, he put his arm
around her, and with Jamie at his other hand the
three went from the room. Strickland tarried a
moment to consult with Mrs. Grizel.</p>

<p>"The doctor comes to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Tibbie thinks him a bit stronger."</p>

<p>"I will watch to-night with Alexander."</p>

<p>"Hoot, man! ye maun be weary enough yourself!"
said Mrs. Grizel.</p>

<p>"No, I am not. I will sleep awhile after supper,
and come in about ten. So you and Tibbie may get
one good night."</p>

<p>Some hours later, in the room that had been his
since his first coming to Glenfernie, he gazed out of
window before turning to go down-stairs. The
snow had ceased to fall, and out of a great streaming
floe of clouds looked a half-moon. Under it
lay wan hill and plain. The clouds were all of a
size and vast in number, a herd of the upper air.
The wind drove them, not like a shepherd, but like
a wolf at their heels. The moon seemed the shepherd,
laboring for control. Then the clouds themselves
seemed the wolves, and the moon a traveler
against whom they leaped, who was thrown among
them, and rose again.... Then the moon was a
soul, struggling with the wrack and wave of things.</p>

<p>Strickland went down the old, winding Glenfernie
stair, and came at last to the laird's room. Tibbie
Ross opened the door to him, and he saw it all in
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>low firelight and made ready for the night. The
laird lay propped as before in the great bed, but
seemed asleep. Alexander sat before the fire, elbows
upon knees and chin in hand, brooding over the red
coals. Tibbie murmured a direction or two and
showed wine and bread set in the deep window.
Then with a courtesy and a breathed, "Gie ye gude
night, sirs!" she was forth to her own rest. The
door closed softly behind her. Strickland stepped
as softly to the chair beyond Alexander. The couch
was spread for the watchers' alternate use, if so
they chose; on a table burned shaded candles.
Strickland had a book in his pocket. Sitting down,
he produced this, for he would not seem to watch
the man by the fire.</p>

<p>Alexander Jardine, large and strong of frame, with
a countenance massive and thoughtful for so young
a man, bronzed, with well-turned features, gazed
steadily into the red hollows where the light played,
withdrew and played again. Strickland tried to
read, but the sense of the other's presence affected
him, came between his mind and the page. Involuntarily
he began to occupy himself with Alexander
and to picture his life away from Glenfernie,
away, too, from Edinburgh and Scotland. It was
now six years since, definitely, he had given up the
law, throwing himself, as it were, on the laird's
mercy both for long and wide travel, and for life
among books other than those indicated for advocates.
The laird had let him go his gait&mdash;the laird
with Mrs. Jardine a little before him. The Jardine
fortune was not a great one, but there was enough
for an heir who showed no inclination to live and
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>to travel <i>en prince</i>, who in certain ways was nearer
the ascetic than the spendthrift.... Before Strickland's
mind, strolling dreamily, came pictures of far
back, of years ago, of long since. A by-wind had
brought to the tutor then certain curious bits of
knowledge. Alexander, a student in Edinburgh, had
lived for some time upon half of his allowance in
order to accommodate Ian Rullock with the other
half, the latter being in a crisis of quarrel with his
uncle, who, when he quarreled, used always, where
he could, the money screw. Strickland had listened
to his Edinburgh informant, but had never divulged
the news given. No more had he told another
bit, floated to him again by that ancient Edinburgh
friend and gossip, who had young cousins at
college and listened to their talk. It pertained to
a time a little before that of the shared income.
This time it had been shared blood. Strickland,
sitting with his book in the quiet room, saw in
imagination the students' chambers in Edinburgh,
and the little throng of very young men, flushed with
wine and with youth, making friendships, and talking
of friendships made, and dubbing Alexander
Damon and Ian Pythias. Then more wine and a
bravura passage. Damon and Pythias opening each
a vein with some convenient dagger, smearing into
the wound some drops of the other's blood, and
going home each with a tourniquet above the right
wrist.... Well, that was years ago&mdash;and youth
loved such passages!</p>

<p>Alexander, by the fire, stooped to put back a
coal that had fallen upon the oak boards, then sank
again into his reverie. Strickland read a paragraph
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>without any especial comprehension, after which
he found himself again by the stream of Alexander's
life. That friendship with Ian Rullock utterly held,
he believed. Well, Ian Rullock, too, seemed somehow
a great personage. Very different from Alexander,
and yet somehow large to match.... Where
had Alexander been after Edinburgh&mdash;where had
he not been? Very often Ian was with him, but
sometimes and for months he would seem to have
been alone. Glenfernie might receive letters from
Germany, from Italy or Egypt, or from further yet
to the east. He had been alone this year, for Ian
was now the King's man and with his regiment,
Strickland supposed, wherever that might be.
Alexander had written from Buda-Pesth, from Erfurt,
from Amsterdam, from London. Now he sat
here at Glenfernie, looking into the fire. Strickland,
who liked books of travel, wondered what he
saw of old cities, grave or gay, of ruined temples,
sphinxes, monuments, grass-grown battle-fields, and
ships at sea, storied lands, peoples, individual men
and women. He had wayfared long; he must have
had many an adventure. He had been from childhood
a learner. His touch upon a book spoke of
adeptship in that world.... Well, here he was, and
what would he do now, when he was laird? Strickland
lost himself in speculation. Little or naught
had ever been in Alexander's letters about women.</p>

<p>The white ash fell, the clock ticked, the wind
went around the house with a faint, banshee crying.
The figure by the fire rested there, silent, still, and
brooding. Strickland observed with some wonder
its power of long, concentrated thinking. It sat
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>there, not visibly tense, seemingly relaxed, yet as
evidently looking into some place of inner motion,
wider and swifter than that of the night world about
it. Strickland tried to read. The clock hand moved
toward midnight.</p>

<p>The laird spoke from the great bed. "Alexander&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am here, father." Alexander rose and went
to the sick man's side. "You slept finely! And
here we have food for you, and drops to give you
strength&mdash;"</p>

<p>The laird swallowed the drops and a spoonful or
two of broth. "There. Now I want to talk. Aye,
I am strong enough. I feel stronger. I am strong.
It hurts me more to check me. Is that the wind
blowing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a wild night."</p>

<p>"It is singing. I could almost pick out the words.
Alexander, there's a quarrel I have with Touris of
Black Hill. I have no wish to make it up. He did
me a wrong and is a sinner in many ways. But his
sister is different. If you see her tell her that I
aye liked her."</p>

<p>"Would it make you happier to be reconciled to
Mr. Touris?"</p>

<p>"No, it would not! You were never a canting
one, Alexander! Let that be. Anger is anger, and
it's weakness to gainsay it! That is," said the laird,
"when it's just&mdash;and this is just. Alexander, my
bonny man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm here, father."</p>

<p>"I've been lying here, gaeing up and down in my
thoughts, a bairn again with my grandmither, gaeing
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>up and down the braes and by the glen. I want
to say somewhat to you. When you see an adder
set your heel upon it! When a wolf goes by take
your firelock and after him! When a denier and a
cheat is near you tell the world as much and help
to set the snare! Where there are betrayers and
persecutors hunt the wild plant shall make a cup
like their ain!" He fell to coughing, coughing more
and more violently.</p>

<p>Strickland rose and came to the bedside, and the
two watchers gave him water and wine to drink,
and would have had him, when the fit was over,
cease from all speech. He shook them off.</p>

<p>"Alexander, ye're like me. Ye're mair like me
than any think! Where ye find your Grierson of
Lagg, clench with him&mdash;clench&mdash;Alexander!"</p>

<p>He coughed, lifting himself in their arms. A
blood-vessel broke. Tibbie Ross, answering the calling,
hurried in. "Gude with us! it's the end!"
Mrs. Grizel came, wrapped in a great flowered bed-gown.
In a few minutes all was over. Strickland
and Alexander laid him straight that had been the
laird.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The month was May. The laird of Glenfernie,
who had walked to the Kelpie's Pool, now came
down the glen. Mother Binning was yet in her cot,
though an older woman now and somewhat broken.</p>

<p>"Oh aye, my bonny man! All things die and all
things live. To and fro gaes the shuttle!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie sat on the door-stone. She took all
the news he could bring, and had her own questions
to put.</p>

<p>"How's the house and all in it?"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Ye've got a bonny sister! Whom will she
marry? There's Abercrombie and Fleming and
Ferguson."</p>

<p>"I do not know. The one she likes the best."</p>

<p>"And when will ye be marrying yourself?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to marry, Mother. I would
marry Wisdom, if I could!"</p>

<p>"Hoot! she stays single! Do ye love the hunt
of Wisdom so?"</p>

<p>"Aye, I do. But it's a long, long chase&mdash;and to
tell you the truth, at times I think she's just a wraith!
And at times I am lazy and would just sit in the sun
and be a fool."</p>

<p>"Like to-day?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>"Like to-day. And so," said Alexander, rising,
"as I feel that way, I'll e'en be going on!"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that maist of the wise have inner
tokens by which they ken the fule. I was ne'er
afraid of folly," said Mother Binning. "It's good
growing stuff!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie laughed and left her and the drone of
her wheel. A clucking hen and her brood, the cot
and its ash-tree, sank from sight. A little longer
and he reached the middle glen where the banks
approached and the full stream rushed with a manifold
sound. Here was the curtain of brier masking
the cave that he had shared with Ian. He drew it
aside and entered. So much smaller was the place
than it had seemed in boyhood! Twice since they
came to be men had he been here with Ian, and they
had smiled over their cavern, but felt for it a tenderness.
In a corner lay the fagots that, the last
time, they had gathered with laughter and left here
against outlaws' needs. Ian! He pictured Ian
with his soldiers.</p>

<p>Outside the cavern, the air came about him like
a cloud of fragrance. As he went down the glen,
into its softer sweeps, this increased, as did the
song of birds. The primrose was strewn about in
disks of pale gold, the white thorn lifted great
bouquets, the bluebell touched the heart. A lark
sang in the sky, linnet and cuckoo at hand, in the
wood at the top of the glen cooed the doves. The
water rippled by the leaning birches, the wild bees
went from flower to flower. The sky was all sapphire,
the air a perfumed ocean. So beautiful rang
the spring that it was like a bell in the heart, in the
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>blood. The laird of Glenfernie, coming to a great
natural chair of sun-warmed rock, sat down to listen.
All was of a sweetness, poignant, intense. But in
the very act of recognizing this, there came upon
him an old mood of melancholy, an inner mist and
chill, a gray languor and wanting. The very
bourgeoning and blossoming about him seemed to
draw light from him, not give light. "I brought the
Kelpie's Pool back with me," he thought. He shut
his eyes, leaning his head against the stone, at last
with a sideward movement burying it in his folded
arms. "More life&mdash;more! What was a great current
goes sluggish and landbound. Where again is
the open sea&mdash;the more&mdash;the boundless? Where
again&mdash;where again?"</p>

<p>He sat for an hour by the wild, singing stream.
It drenched him, the loved place and the sweet
season, with its thousand store of beauties. Its
infinite number of touches brought at last response.
The vague crying and longing of nature hushed before
a present lullaby. At last he rose and went on
with the calling stream.</p>

<p>The narrow path, set about with living green, with
the spangly flowers, and between the branches fragments
of the blue lift as clear as glass, led down the
glen, widening now to hill and dale. Softening and
widening, the world laughed in May. The stream
grew broad and tranquil, with grassy shores overhung
by green boughs. Here and there the bank extended
into the flood a little grassy cape edged with
violets. Alexander, following the spiral of the path,
came upon the view of such a spot as this. It lay
just before him, a little below his road. The stream
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>washed its fairy beach. From the new grass rose a
blooming thorn-tree; beneath this knelt a girl and,
resting upon her hands, looked at her face in the water.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie stood still. A drooping
birch hid him; his step had been upon moss and was
not heard. The face and form upon the bank, the
face in the water, showed no consciousness of any
human neighbor. The face was that of a woman of
perhaps twenty-four. The hair was brown, the
eyes brown. The head was beautifully placed on a
round, smooth throat. With a wide forehead, with
great width between the eyes, the face tapered to a
small round chin. The mouth and under the eyes
smiled in a thousand different ways. The beauty
that was there was subtle, not discoverable by every
one.&mdash;The girl settled back upon the grass beneath
the thorn-tree. She was very near Glenfernie; he
could see the rise and fall of her bosom beneath her
blue print gown. It was Elspeth Barrow&mdash;he knew
her now, though he had not seen her for a long
time. She sat still, her brown eyes raised to building
birds in the thorn-tree. Then she began herself
to sing, clear and sweet.</p>

<p>She sang it through, then sat entirely still against
the stem of the thorn, while about her lips played
that faint, unapproachable, glamouring smile. Her
hands touched the grass to either side her body;
her slender, blue-clad figure, the all of her, smote
him like some god's line of poetry.</p>

<p>There was in the laird of Glenfernie's nature an
empty palace. It had been built through ages and
every wind of pleasure and pain had blown about it.
Then it had slowly come about that the winds of
pain had increased upon the winds of pleasure. The
mind closed the door of the palace and the nature
inclined to turn from it. It was there, but a sea
mist hid it, and a tall thorn-hedge, and a web
stretched across its idle gates. It had hardly come,
in this life, into Glenfernie's waking mind that it
was there at all.</p>

<p>Now with a suddenness every door clanged open.
The mist parted, the thorn-wood sank, the web was
torn. The palace stood, shining like home, and it
was he who was afar, in the mist and the wood, and
the web of idleness and oblivion in shreds about him.
Set in the throne-room, upon the throne, he saw the
queen.</p>

<p>His mood, that May day, had given the moment,
and wide circumstance had met it. Now the hand
was in the glove, the statue in the niche, the bow
upon the string, the spark in the tinder, the sea
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>through the dike. Now what had reached being
must take its course.</p>

<p>He felt that so fatally that he did not think of
resistance.... Elspeth, upon the grassy cape, beneath
the blooming thorn, heard steps down the
glen path, and turned her eyes to see the young
laird moving between the birch stems. Now he was
level with the holding; now he spoke to her, lifting
his hat. She answered, with the smile beneath her
eyes:</p>

<p>"Aye, Glenfernie, it's a braw day!"</p>

<p>"May I come into the fairy country and sit
awhile and visit?"</p>

<p>"Aye." She welcomed him to a hillock of green
rising from the water's edge. "It <i>is</i> fairyland, and
these are the broad seas around, and I know if I
came here by night I should find the Good People
before me!" She looked at him with friendliness,
half shy, half frank. "It is the best of weather for
wandering."</p>

<p>"Are you fond of that, too? Do you go up and
down alone?"</p>

<p>"By my lee-lane when Gilian's not here. She's
in Aberdeen now, where live our mother's folk."</p>

<p>"I have not seen you for years."</p>

<p>"I mind the last time. Your mother lay ill.
One evening at sunset Mr. Ian Rullock and you came
to White Farm."</p>

<p>"It must have been after sunset. It must have
been dark."</p>

<p>"Back of that you and he came from Edinburgh
one time. We were down by the wishing-green,
Robin Greenlaw and Gilian and I and three or four
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>other lads and lassies. Do you remember? Mr.
Rullock would have us dance, and we all took hands&mdash;you,
too&mdash;and went around the ash-tree as though
it were a May-pole. We changed hands, one with
another, and danced upon the green. Then you and
he got upon your horses and rode away. He was
riding the white mare Fatima. But oh," said
Elspeth, "then came grandfather, who had seen us
from the reaped field, and he blamed us sair and
put no to our playing! He gave word to the minister,
and Sunday the sermon dealt with the ill women of
Scripture. Back of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Back of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was the day the two of you would go to
the Kelpie's Pool." Elspeth's eyes enlarged and
darkened. "The next morn we heard&mdash;Jock Binning
told us&mdash;that Mr. Ian had nearly drowned."</p>

<p>"Almost ten years ago. Once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice in
ten years. How idly were they spent, those years!"</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Elspeth, "they say that you have
been to world's end and have gotten great learning!"</p>

<p>"One comes home from all that to find world's
end and great learning."</p>

<p>Elspeth leaned from him, back against the thorn-tree.
She looked somewhat disquietedly, somewhat
questioningly, at this new laird. Glenfernie, in his
turn, laid upon himself both hands of control. He
thought:</p>

<p>"Do not peril all&mdash;do not peril all&mdash;with haste
and frightening!"</p>

<p>He sat upon the green hillock and talked of
country news. She met him with this and that ...
White Farm affairs, Littlefarm.</p>

<p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>"Robin," said Alexander, "manages so well that
he'll grow wealthy!"</p>

<p>"Oh no! He manages well, but he'll never grow
wealthy outside! But inside he has great riches."</p>

<p><i>"Does she love him, then?"</i> It poured fear into
his heart. A magician with a sword&mdash;with a great,
evil, written-upon creese like that hanging at Black
Hill&mdash;was here before the palace.</p>

<p>"Do you love him?" asked Alexander, and asked
it with so straight a simplicity that Elspeth Barrow
took no offense.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and those strange smiles played
about her lips. "Robin is a fairy man," she said.
"He has ower little of struggle save with his rhymes,"
and left him to make what he could of that.</p>

<p>"She is heart-free," he thought, but still he feared
and boded.</p>

<p>Elspeth rose from the grass, stepped from beneath
the blooming tree. "I must be going. It wears
toward noon."</p>

<p>Together they left the flower-set cape. The laird
of Glenfernie looked back upon it.</p>

<p>"<i>Heaven sent a sample down.</i> You come here when
you wish? You walk about with the spring and
summer days?"</p>

<p>"Aye, when my work's done. Gilian and I love
the greenwood."</p>

<p>He gave her the narrow path, but kept beside
her on stone and dead leaves and mossy root.
Though he was so large of frame, he moved with a
practised, habitual ease, as far as might be from
any savor of clumsiness. He had magnetism, and
to-day he drew like a planet in glow. Now he looked
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>at the woman beside him, and now he looked straight
ahead with kindled eyes.</p>

<p>Elspeth walked with slightly quickened breath,
with knitted brows. The laird of Glenfernie was
above her in station, though go to the ancestors
and blood was equal enough! It carried appeal to
a young woman's vanity, to be walking so, to feel
that the laird liked well enough to be where he was.
She liked him, too. Glenfernie House was talked
of, talked of, by village and farm and cot, talked of,
talked of, year by year&mdash;all the Jardines, their virtues
and their vices, what they said and what they
did. She had heard, ever since she was a bairn,
that continual comment, like a little prattling burn
running winter and summer through the dale. So
she knew much that was true of Alexander Jardine,
but likewise entertained a sufficient amount of misapprehension
and romancing. Out of it all came,
however, for the dale, and for the women at White
Farm who listened to the burn's voice, a sense of
trustworthiness. Elspeth, walking by Glenfernie,
felt kindness for him. If, also, there ran a tremor
of feeling that it was very fair to be Elspeth Barrow
and walking so, she was young and it was natural.
But beyond that was a sense, vague, unexplained
to herself, but disturbing. There was feeling in
him that was not in her. She was aware of it as
she might be aware of a gathering storm, though the
brain received as yet no clear message. She felt, struggling
with that diffused kindness and young vanity,
something like discomfort and fear. So her mood
was complex enough, unharmonized, parted between
opposing currents. She was a riddle to herself.</p>

<p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>But Glenfernie walked in a great simplicity of
faeryland or heaven. She did not love Robin Greenlaw;
she was not so young a lass, with a rose in
her cheek for every one; she was come so far without
mating because she had snow in her heart!
The palace gleamed, the palace shone. All the
music of earth&mdash;of the world&mdash;poured through.
The sun had drunk up the mist, time had eaten the
thorn-wood, the spider at the gate had vanished
into chaos and old night.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>The cows and sheep and work-horses, the dogs,
the barn-yard fowls, the very hives of bees at
White Farm, seemed to know well enough that it
was the Sabbath. The flowers knew it that edged
the kitchen garden, the cherry-tree knew it by the
southern wall. The sunshine knew it, wearing its
calm Sunday best. Sights and sounds attuned themselves.</p>

<p>The White Farm family was home from kirk.
Jenny Barrow and Elspeth put away hood and wide
hat of straw, slipped from and shook out and folded
on the shelf Sunday gowns and kerchiefs. Then
each donned a clean print and a less fine kerchief
and came forth to direct and aid the two cotter
lasses who served at White Farm. These by now
had off their kirk things, but they marked Sunday
still by keeping shoes and stockings. Menie and
Merran, Elspeth and Jenny, set the yesterday-prepared
dinner cold upon the table, drew the ale, and
placed chairs and stools. Two men, Thomas and
Willy, father and son, who drove the plow, sowed
and reaped, for White Farm, came from the barn.
They were yet Sunday-clad, with very clean, shining
faces. "Call father, Elspeth!" directed Jenny,
and set on the table a honeycomb.</p>

<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>Elspeth went without the door. Before the house
grew a great fir-tree that had a bench built around
it. Here, in fine weather, in rest hours and on Sunday,
might be looked for Jarvis Barrow. It was
his habit to take the far side of the tree, with the
trunk between him and the house. So there spread
before him the running river, the dale and moor,
and at last the piled hills. Here he sat, leaning
hands upon a great stick shaped like a crook, his
Bible open upon his knees. It was a great book,
large of print, read over in every part, but opening
most easily among the prophets. No cry, no
denunciation, no longing, no judgment from Isaiah
to Malachi, but was known to the elder of the kirk.
Now he sat here, in his Sunday dress, with the
Bible. At a little distance, on the round bench, sat
Robin Greenlaw. The old man read sternly, concentratedly
on; the young one looked at the purple
mountain-heads. Elspeth came around the
tree.</p>

<p>"Grandfather, dinner is ready.&mdash;Robin! we didn't
know that you were here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I went the way around to speak with the laird.
Then I thought, 'I will eat at White Farm&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"You're welcome!&mdash;Grandfather, let me take the
Book."</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, and bore it himself
withindoors. Spare and unbent of frame, threescore
and ten and five, and able yet at the plow-stilts,
rigid of will, servant to the darker Calvinism,
starving where he might human pride and human
affections, and yet with much of both to starve,
he moved and spoke with slow authority, looked
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>a patriarch and ruled his holding. When presently
he came to table in the clean, sanded room with
the sunlight on the wall and floor, and when, standing,
he said the long, the earnest grace, it might
have been taken that here, in the Scotch farm-house,
was at least a minor prophet. The grace
was long, a true wrestling in prayer. Ended, a
decent pause was made, then all took place, Jarvis
Barrow and his daughter and granddaughter, Robin
Greenlaw, Thomas and Willy, Menie and Merran.
The cold meat, the bread, and other food were
passed from hand to hand, the ale poured. The
Sunday hush, the Sunday voices, continued to hold.
Jarvis Barrow would have no laughter and idle
clashes at his table on the Lord's day. Menie and
Merran and Willy kept a stolid air, with only
now and then a sidelong half-smile or nudging request
for this or that. Elspeth ate little, sat with
her brown eyes fixed out of the window. Robin
Greenlaw ate heartily enough, but he had an air
distrait, and once or twice he frowned. But Jenny
Barrow could not long keep still and incurious,
even upon the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>"Eh, Robin, what was your crack with the
laird?"</p>

<p>"He wants to buy Warlock for James Jardine.
He's got his ensign's commission to go fight the
French."</p>

<p>"Eh, he'll be a bonny lad on Warlock! I thought
you wadna sell him?"</p>

<p>"I'll sell to Glenfernie."</p>

<p>The farmer spoke from the head of the table.
"I'll na hae talk, Robin, of buying and selling on
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>the day! It clinks like the money-changers and
sellers of doves."</p>

<p>Thomas, his helper, raised his head from a plate
of cold mutton. "Glenfernie was na at kirk. He's
na the kirkkeeper his father was. Na, na!"</p>

<p>"Na," said the farmer. "Bairns dinna walk
nowadays in parents' ways."</p>

<p>Willy had a bit of news he would fain get in.
"Nae doot Glenfernie's brave, but he wadna be a
sodger, either! I was gaeing alang wi' the yowes,
and there was he and Drummielaw riding and gabbing.
Sae there cam on a skirling and jumping
wind and rain, and we a' gat under a tree, the yowes
and the dogs and Glenfernie and Drummielaw and
me. Then we changed gude day and they went on
gabbing. And 'Nae,' says Glenfernie, 'I am nae
lawyer and I am nae sodger. Jamie wad be the
last, but brithers may love and yet be thinking far
apairt. The best friend I hae in the warld is a
sodger, but I'm thinking I hae lost the knack o'
fechting. When you lose the taste you lose the
knack.'"</p>

<p>"I's fearing," said Thomas, "that he's lost the
taste o' releegion!"</p>

<p>"Eh," exclaimed Jenny Barrow, "but he's a
bonny big man! He came by yestreen, and I
thought, 'For a' there is sae muckle o' ye, ye look
as though ye walked on air!'"</p>

<p>Thomas groaned. "Muckle tae be saved, muckle
tae be lost!"</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow spoke from the head of the table.
"If fowk canna talk on the Sabbath o' spiritual
things, maybe they can mak shift to haud the
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>tongue in their chafts! I wad think that what we
saw and heard the day wad put ye ower the burn
frae vain converse!"</p>

<p>Thomas nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Aweel&mdash;" began Jenny, but did not find just
the words with which to continue.</p>

<p>Elspeth, turning ever so slightly in her chair,
looked farther off to the hills and summer clouds.
A slow wave of color came over her face and throat.
Menie and Merran looked sidelong each at the
other, then their blue eyes fell to their plates. But
Willy almost audibly smacked his lips.</p>

<p>"Gude keep us! the meenister gaed thae sinners
their licks!"</p>

<p>"A sair sight, but an eedifying!" said Thomas.</p>

<p>Robin Greenlaw pushed back his chair. He saw
the inside of the kirk again, and two miserable,
loutish, lawless lovers standing for public discipline.
His color rose. "Aye, it was a sair sight," he said,
abruptly, made a pause, then went on with the
impetuousness of a burn unlocked from winter ice.
"If I should say just what I think, I suppose, uncle,
that I could not come here again! So I'll e'en say
only that I think that was a sair sight and that I
felt great shame and pity for all sinners. So, feeling
it for all, I felt it for Mallie and Jock, standing
there an hour, first on one foot and then on the
other, to be gloated at and rebukit, and for the
minister doing the rebuking, and for the kirkful all
gloating, and thinking, 'Lord, not such are we!' and
for Robin Greenlaw who often enough himself takes
wildfire for true light! I say I think it was sair
sight and sair doing&mdash;"</p>

<p><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>Barrow's hand came down upon the table.
"Robin Greenlaw!"</p>

<p>"You need not thunder at me, sir. I'm done! I
did not mean to make such a clatter, for in this
house what clatter makes any difference? It's the
sinner makes the clatter, and it's just promptly
sunk and lost in godliness!"</p>

<p>The old man and the young turned in their
chairs, faced each other. They looked somewhat
alike, and in the heart of each was fondness for the
other. Greenlaw, eye to eye with the patriarch,
felt his wrath going.</p>

<p>"Eh, uncle, I did not mean to hurt the Sunday!"</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow spoke with the look and the
weight of a prophet in Israel. "What is your quarrel
about, and for what are ye flyting against the kirk
and the minister and the kirkkeepers? Are ye wanting
that twa sinners, having sinned, should hae
their sin for secret and sweet to their aneselves,
gilded and pairfumed and excused and unnamed?
Are ye wanting that nane should know, and the
plague should live without the doctor and without
the mark upon the door? Or are ye thinking that
it is nae plague at all, nae sin, and nae blame? Then
ye be atheist, Robin Greenlaw, and ye gae indeed
frae my door, and wad gae were ye na my nephew,
but my son!" He gathered force. "Elder of the
kirk, I sit here, and I tell ye that were it my ain
flesh and blood that did evil, my stick and my plaid
I wad take and ower the moor I wad gae to tell
manse and parish that Sin, the wolf, had crept into
the fauld! And I wad see thae folly-crammed and
sinfu' sauls, that had let him in and had his bite,
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>set for shame and shawing and warning and example
before the congregation, and I wad say to the minister,
'Lift voice against them and spare not!' And
I wad be there the day and in my seat, though my
heart o' flesh was like to break!" His hand fell
again heavily upon the board. "Sae weak and
womanish is thae time we live in!" He flashed at
his great-nephew. "Sae poetical! It wasna sae
when the Malignants drove us and we fled to the
hills and were fed on the muirs with the word of the
Lord! It wasna sae in the time when Gawin
Elliot that Glenfernie draws frae was hanged for
gieing us that word! Then gin a sin-blasted ane
was found amang us, his road indeed was shawn
him! Aye, were't man or woman! <i>'For while they
be folded together as thorns, and while they are drunken
as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully
dry!'</i>"</p>

<p>He pushed back his heavy chair; he rose from
table and went forth, tall, ancient, gray, armored
in belief. They heard him take his Bible from
where it lay, and knew that he was back under the
fir-tree, facing from the house toward moor and hill
and mountain.</p>

<p>"Eh-h," groaned Thomas, "the elder is a mighty
witness!"</p>

<p>The family at White Farm ate in silence. Elspeth
slipped from her place.</p>

<p>"Where are ye gaeing, hinny?" asked Jenny.
"Ye hae eaten naething."</p>

<p>"I've finished," said Elspeth. "I'm going to
afternoon kirk, and I'll be getting ready."</p>

<p>She went into the room that she shared with
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>Gilian and shut the door. Robin looked after
her.</p>

<p>"When is Gilian coming home?"</p>

<p>"Naebody knows. She is sae weel at Aberdeen!
They write that she is a great student and is liked
abune a', and they clamor to keep her.&mdash;Are ye
gaeing to second kirk, Robin?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so. But I'll walk over the moor
with you."</p>

<p>The meal ended. Thomas and Willy went forth
to the barn. Menie and Merran began to clear the
table. They were not going to second kirk, and
so the work was left to their hand. Jenny bustled
to get on again her Sunday gear. She would not
have missed, for a pretty, afternoon kirk and all
the neighbors who were twice-goers. It was fair
and theater and promenade and kirk to her in one&mdash;though
of course she only said "kirk."</p>

<p>They walked over the moor, Jarvis Barrow and
Jenny and Robin and Elspeth. And at a crossing
path they came upon a figure seated on a stone
and found it to be that of the laird of Glenfernie.</p>

<p>"Gude day, Glenfernie!"</p>

<p>"Good day, White Farm!"</p>

<p>He joined himself to them. For a moment he and
Robin Greenlaw were together.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I hear them calling you?"
quoth the latter. "I hear them say 'The wandering
laird!'"</p>

<p>Alexander smiled. "That's not so bad a name!"</p>

<p>He walked now beside Jarvis Barrow. The old
man's stride was hardly shortened by age. The
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>two kept ahead of the two women, Greenlaw,
Thomas, and the sheep-dog Sandy.</p>

<p>"It's a bonny day, White Farm!"</p>

<p>"Aye, it's bonny eneuch, Glenfernie. Are ye for
kirk?"</p>

<p>"Maybe so, maybe not. I take much of my kirk
out of doors. Moors make grand kirks. That has
a sound, has it not, of heathenish brass cymbals?"</p>

<p>"It hae."</p>

<p>"All the same, I honor every kirk that stands
sincere."</p>

<p>"Wasna your father sincere? Why gae ye not
in his steps?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I do.... Yes, he was sincere. I trust
that I am so, too. I would be."</p>

<p>"Why gae ye not in his steps, then?"</p>

<p>"All buildings are not alike and yet they may
be built sincerely."</p>

<p>"Ye're wrong! Ye'll see it one day. Ye'll come
round to your father's steps, only ye'll tread them
deeper! Ye've got it in you, to the far back. I
hear good o' ye, and I hear ill o' ye."</p>

<p>"Belike."</p>

<p>"Ye've traveled. See if ye can travel out of the
ring of God!"</p>

<p>"What is the ring of God? If it is as large as I
think it is," said Glenfernie, "I'll not travel out of
it."</p>

<p>He looked out over moor and moss. There
breathed about him something that gave the old
man wonder. "Hae ye gold-mines and jewels,
Glenfernie? Hae the King made ye Minister?"</p>

<p>The wandering laird laughed. "Better than
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>that, White Farm, better than that!" He was
tempted then and there to say: "I love your granddaughter
Elspeth. I love Elspeth!" It was his intention
to say something like this as soon as might
be to White Farm. "I love Elspeth and Elspeth
loves me. So we would marry, White Farm, and
she be lady beside the laird at Glenfernie." But he
could not say it yet, because he did not know if
Elspeth loved him. He was in a condition of hope,
but very humbly so, far from assurance. He
never did Elspeth the indignity of thinking that a
lesser thing than love might lead her to Glenfernie
House. If she came she would come because she
loved&mdash;not else.</p>

<p>They left the moor, passed through the hollow
of the stream and by the mill, and began to climb
the village street. Folk looked out of door or window
upon them; kirk-goers astir, dressed in their
best, with regulated step and mouth and eyes
set aright, gave the correct greeting, neither more
nor less. If the afternoon breeze, if a little runlet
of water going down the street, chose to murmur:
"The laird is thick with White Farm! What
makes the laird so thick with White Farm?" that
was breeze or runlet's doing.</p>

<p>They passed the bare, gaunt manse and came to
the kirkyard with the dark, low stones over the
generations dead. But the grass was vivid, and
the daisies bloomed, and even the yew-trees had
some kind of peacock sheen, while the sky overhead
burnt essential sapphire. Even the white of
the lark held a friendly tinge as of rose petals mixed
somehow with it. And the bell that was ending its
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>ringing, if it was solemn, was also silver-sweet.
Glenfernie determined that he would go to church.
He entered with the White Farm folk and he sat
with them, leaving the laird's high-walled, curtained
pew without human tenancy. Mrs. Grizel
came but to morning sermon. Alice was with a
kinswoman of rank in a great house near Edinburgh,
submitting, not without enjoyment, to certain fine
filings and polishings and lacquerings and contacts.
Jamie, who would be a soldier and fight the French,
had his commission and was gone this past week
to Carlisle, to his regiment. English Strickland was
yet at Glenfernie House. Between him and the
laird held much liking and respect. Tutor no longer,
he stayed on as secretary and right-hand man. But
Strickland was not at church.</p>

<p>The white cavern, bare and chill, with small,
deep windows looking out upon the hills of June,
was but sparely set out with folk. Afternoon was
not morning. Nor was there again the disciplinary
vision of the forenoon. The sinners were not set
the second time for a gazing-stock. It was just
usual afternoon kirk. The prayer was made, the
psalm was sung, Mr. M'Nab preached a strong if
wintry sermon. Jarvis Barrow, white-headed, strong-featured,
intent, sat as in some tower over against
Jerusalem, considering the foes that beset her.
Beside him sat his daughter Jenny, in striped petticoat
and plain overgown, blue kerchief, and
hat of straw. Next to Jenny was Elspeth in a
dim-green stuff, thin, besprent with small flowers,
a fine white kerchief, and a wider straw hat.
Robin Greenlaw sat beside Elspeth, and the laird
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>by Greenlaw. Half the congregation thought with
variations:</p>

<p>"Wha ever heard of the laird's not being in his
ain place? He and White Farm and Littlefarm
maun be well acquaint'! He's foreign, amaist,
and gangs his ain gait!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie, who had broken the conventions, sat
in a profound carelessness of that. The kirk was
not gray to him to-day, though he had thought it
so on other days, nor bare, nor chill. June was
without, but June was more within. He also
prayed, though his unuttered words ran in and out
between the minister's uttered ones. Under the
wintry sermon he built a dream and it glowed like
jewels. At the psalm, standing, he heard Elspeth's
clear voice praising God, and his heart lifted on that
beam of song until it was as though it came to
Heaven.</p>

<p>"Love, love, love!" cried Glenfernie's heart. His
nature did with might what its hand found to do,
and now, having turned to love between man and
woman, it loved with a huge, deep, pulsing, world-old
strength. He heard Elspeth, he felt Elspeth
only; he but wished to blend with her and go on
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>with her forever from the heaven to heaven which,
blended so, they would make.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>The glen was dressed in June, at its height of
green movement and song. Alexander and
Elspeth walked there and turned aside through a
miniature pass down which flowed a stream in
miniature to join the larger flood. This cleft led
them to a green hollow masked by the main wall
of the glen, a fairy place, hidden and lone. Seven
times had the two been in company since that
morning of the flower-sprinkled cape and the thorn-tree.
First stood a chance meeting upon the moor,
Elspeth walking from the village with a basket
upon her arm and the laird riding home after business
in the nearest considerable town. He dismounted;
he walked beside her to the stepping-stones
before the farm. The second time he went
to White Farm, and she and Jenny, with Merran
to help, were laying linen to bleach upon the sun-washed
hillside. He had stayed an hour, and though
he was not alone with her, yet he might look at her,
listen to her. She was not a chatterer; she worked
or stood, almost as silent as a master painter's subtle
picture stepped out of its frame, or as Pygmalion's
statue-maid, flushing with life, but as yet tongue-holden.
Yet she said certain things, and they were
to him all music and wit. The third time had been
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>by the wishing-green. That was but for a moment,
but he counted it great gain.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, "was where we danced! Mr.
Ian Rullock and you and Robin and the rest of us.
Don't you remember? It was evening and there
was a fleet of gold clouds in the sky. It is so near
the house. I walk here when I have a glint of time."</p>

<p>The fourth time, riding Black Alan, he had stopped
at the door and talked with Jarvis Barrow. He was
thirsty and had asked for water, and Jenny had
called, "Elspeth, bring the laird a cup frae the well!"
She had brought it, and, taking it from her, all the
romance of the world had seemed to him to close
them round, to bear them to some great and fair
and deep and passionate place. The fifth time had
been the day when he went to kirk with White Farm
and listened to her voice in the psalm. The sixth
time had been again upon the moor. The seventh
time was this. He had come down through the
glen as he had done before. He had no reason to
suppose that this day more than another he would
find her, but there, half a mile from White Farm,
he came upon her, standing, watching a lintwhite's
nest. They walked together, and when that little,
right-angled, infant fellow of the glen opened to
them they turned and followed its bright rivulet to
the green hidden hollow.</p>

<p>The earth lay warm and dry, clad with short turf.
They sat down beneath an oak-tree. None would
come this way; they had to themselves a bright
span of time and place. Elspeth looked at him
with brown, friendly eyes. Each time she met him
her eyes grew more kind; more and more she liked
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>the laird. Something fluttered in her nature; like
a bird in a room with many windows and all but one
closed, it turned now this way, now that, seeking
the open lattice. There was the lovely world&mdash;which
way to it? And the window that in a dream
had seemed to her to open was mayhap closed, and
another that she had not noted mayhap opening....
But Glenfernie, winged, was in that world, and
now all that he desired was that the bright bird
should fly to him there. But until to-day patience
and caution and much humility had kept him from
direct speech. He knew that she had not loved, as
he had done, at once. He had set himself to win
her to love him. But so great was his passion that
now he thought:</p>

<p>"Surely not one, but two as one, make this terrible
and happy furnace!" He thought, "I will
speak now," and then delayed over the words.</p>

<p>"This is a bonny, wee place!" said Elspeth. "Did
you never hear the old folks tell that your great-grandmother,
that was among the persecuted, loved
it? When your father was a laddie they often used
to sit here, the two of them. They were great
wanderers together."</p>

<p>"I never heard it," said Alexander. "Almost it
seems too bright...."</p>

<p>They sat in silence, but the train of thought
started went on with Glenfernie:</p>

<p>"But perhaps she never went so far as the
Kelpie's Pool."</p>

<p>"The Kelpie's Pool!... I do not like that place!
Tell me, Glenfernie, wonders of travel."</p>

<p>"What shall I tell you?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>"Tell me of the East. Tell me what like is the
Sea of Galilee."</p>

<p>Glenfernie talked, since Elspeth bade him talk.
He talked of what he had seen and known, and that
brought him, with the aid of questions from the
woman listening, to talk of himself. "I had a
strange kind of youth.... So many dim, struggling
longings, dreams, aspirings!&mdash;but I think they may
be always there with youth."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are," said Elspeth.</p>

<p>"We talked of the Kelpie's Pool. Something like
that was the strangeness with me. Black rifts and
whirlpools and dead tarns within me, opening up
now and again, lifted as by a trembling of the earth,
coming up from the past! Angers and broodings, and
things seen in flashes&mdash;then all gone as the lightning
goes, and the mind does not hold what was
shown.... I became a man and it ceased. Sometimes
I know that in sleep or dream I have been
beside a kelpie pool. But I think the better part
of me has drained them where they lay under open
sky." He laughed, put his hands over his face for
a moment, then, dropping them, whistled to the
blackbirds aloft in the oak-tree.</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"Now there is clean fire in me!" He turned to
her; he drew himself nearer over the sward. "Elspeth,
Elspeth, Elspeth! do not tell me that you
do not know that I love you!"</p>

<p>"Love me&mdash;love me?" answered Elspeth. She
rose from her earthen chair; she moved as if to
leave the place; then she stood still. "Perhaps a
part of me knew and a part did not know.... I will
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>try to be honest, for you are honest, Glenfernie!
Yes, I knew, but I would not let myself perceive
and think and say that I knew.... And now what
will I say?"</p>

<p>"Say that you love me! Say that you love and
will marry me!"</p>

<p>"I like you and I trust you, but I feel no more,
Glenfernie, I feel no more!"</p>

<p>"It may grow, Elspeth&mdash;"</p>

<p>Elspeth moved to the stem of the oak beneath
which they had been seated. She raised her arm
and rested it against the bark, then laid her forehead
upon the warm molded flesh in the blue print sleeve.
For some moments she stayed so, with hidden face,
unmoving against the bole of the tree, like a relief
done of old by some wonderful artist. The laird
of Glenfernie, watching her, felt, such was his
passion, the whole of earth and sky, the whole of
time, draw to just this point, hang on just her movement
and her word.</p>

<p>"Elspeth!" he cried at last. "Elspeth!"</p>

<p>Elspeth turned, but she stood yet against the
tree. Now both arms were lifted; she had for a
moment the appearance of one who hung upon the
tree. Her eyes were wet, tears were upon her cheek.
She shook them off, then left the oak and came a
step or two toward him. "There is something in
my brain and heart that tells me what love is.
When I love I shall love hard.... I have had fancies....
But, like yours, Glenfernie, their times are outgrown
and gone by.... It's clear to try. I like you
so much! but I do not love now&mdash;and I'll not wed
and come to Glenfernie House until I do."</p>

<p><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>"'It's clear to try,' you said."</p>

<p>Elspeth looked at him long. "If it is there, even
little and far away, I'll try to bend my steps the
way shall bring it nearer. But, oh, Glenfernie, it
may be that there is naught upon the road!"</p>

<p>"Will you journey to look for it? That's all I
ask now. Will you journey to look for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I may promise that. And I do not know,"
said Elspeth, wonderingly, "what keeps me from
thinking I'll meet it." She sat down among the
oak roots. "Let us rest a bit, and say no word,
and then go home."</p>

<p>The sunlight filled the hollow, the wimpling burn
took the blue of the sky, the breeze whispered among
the oak leaves. The two sat and gazed at the day,
at the grass, at the little thorn-trees and hazels
that ringed the place around. They sat very still,
seeking composure. She gained it first.</p>

<p>"When will your sister be coming home?"</p>

<p>"It is not settled. Glenfernie House was sad of
late years. She ought to have the life and brightness
that she's getting now."</p>

<p>"And will you travel no more?"</p>

<p>He saw as in a lightning glare that she pictured
no change for him beyond such as being laird would
make. He was glad when the flash went and he
could forget what it had of destructive and desolating.
He would drag hope down from the sky above
the sky of lightnings. He spoke.</p>

<p>"There were duties now to be taken up. I could
not stay away all nor most nor much of the time.
I saw that. But I could study here, and once in a
while run somewhere over the earth.... But now I
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>would stay in this dale till I die! Unless you were
with me&mdash;the two of us going to see the sights of the
earth, and then returning home&mdash;going and returning&mdash;going
and returning&mdash;and both a great sweetness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" breathed Elspeth. She put her hands
again over her eyes, and she saw, unrolling, a great
fair life <i>if</i>&mdash;<i>if</i>&mdash;She rose to her feet. "Let us
go! It grows late. They'll miss me."</p>

<p>They came into the glen and so went down with
the stream to the open land and to White Farm.</p>

<p>"Where hae you been?" asked Jenny. "Here
was father hame frae the shearing with his eyes
blurred, speiring for you to read to him!"</p>

<p>"I was walking by the glen and the laird came
down through, so we made here together. Where
is grandfather?"</p>

<p>"He wadna sit waiting. He's gane to walk on
the muir. Will ye na bide, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>But the laird would not stay. It was wearing
toward sunset. Menie, withindoors, called Jenny.
The latter turned away. Glenfernie spoke to
Elspeth.</p>

<p>"If I find your grandfather on the moor I shall
speak of this that is between us. Do not look so
troubled! 'If' or 'if not' it is better to tell. So
you will not be plagued. And, anyhow, it is the
wise folks' road."</p>

<p>Back came Jenny. "Has he gane? I had for
him a tass of wine and a bit of cake."</p>

<p>The moor lay like a stiffened billow of the sea,
green with purple glints. The clear western sky
was ruddy gold, the sun's great ball approaching
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>the horizon. But when it dipped the short June
night would know little dark in this northern land.
The air struck most fresh and pure. Glenfernie came
presently upon the old farmer, found him seated upon
a bit of bank, his gray plaid about him, his crook-like
stick planted before him, his eyes upon the western
sea of glory. The younger man stopped beside
him, settled down upon the bank, and gazed with
the elder into the ocean of colored air.</p>

<p>"Ae gowden floor as though it were glass," said
Jarvis Barrow. "Ae gowden floor and ae river
named of Life, passing the greatness of Orinoco or
Amazon. And the tree of life for the healing of the
nations. And a' the trees that ever leafed or flowered,
ta'en together, but ae withered twig to that!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie gazed with him. "I do not doubt that
there will come a day when we'll walk over the plains
of the sun&mdash;the flesh of our body then as gauze,
moved at will where we please and swift as thought&mdash;inner
and outer motion keeping time with the
beat and rhythm of that <i>where we are</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The young do not speak the auld tongue."</p>

<p>"Tongues alter with the rest."</p>

<p>Silence fell while the sun reddened, going nearer
to the mountain brow. The young man and the old,
the farmer and the laird, sat still. The air struck
more freshly, stronger, coming from the sea. Far
off a horn was blown, a dog barked.</p>

<p>"Will ye be hame now for gude, Glenfernie?
Lairds should bide in their ain houses if the land
is to have any gude of them."</p>

<p>"I wish to stay, White Farm, the greatest part
of the year round. I want to speak to you very
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>seriously. Think back a moment to my father and
mother, and to my forebears farther back yet. As
they had faults, and yet had a longing to do the
right and struggled toward it over thick and thin,
so I believe I may say of myself. That is, I struggle
toward it," said Alexander, "though I'm not
so sure of the thick and thin."</p>

<p>"Your mither wasna your father's kind. She had
always her smile to the side and her japes, and she
looked to the warld. Not that she didna mean to
do weel in it! She did. But I couldna just see clear
the seal in her forehead."</p>

<p>"That was because you did not look close enough,"
said Alexander. "It was there."</p>

<p>"I didna mind your uphawding your mither.
Aweel, what did ye have to say?"</p>

<p>The laird turned full to him. "White Farm,
you were once a young man. You loved and married.
So do I love, so would I marry! The woman
I love does not yet love me, but she has, I think,
some liking.&mdash;I bide in hope. I would speak to you
about it, as is right."</p>

<p>"Wha is she?"</p>

<p>"Your granddaughter Elspeth."</p>

<p>Silence, while the shadows of the trees in the vale
below grew longer and longer. Then said White
Farm:</p>

<p>"She isna what they call your equal in station.
And she has nae tocher or as good as nane."</p>

<p>"For the last I have enough for us both. For the
first the springs of Barrow and Jardine, back in
Time's mountains, are much the same. Scotland's
not the country to bother overmuch if the one
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>stream goes, in a certain place, through a good farm,
and the other by a not over-rich laird's house."</p>

<p>"Are ye Whig and Kirk like your father?"</p>

<p>"I am Whig&mdash;until something more to the dawn
than that comes up. For the Kirk ... I will tell truth
and say that I have my inner differences. But they
do not lean toward Pope or prelate.... I am Christian,
where Christ is taken very universally&mdash;the
higher Self, the mounting Wisdom of us all.... Some
high things you and I may view differently, but I
believe that there are high things."</p>

<p>"And seek them?"</p>

<p>"And seek them."</p>

<p>"You always had the air to me," vouchsafed
White Farm, "of one wha hunted gowd elsewhaur
than in the earthly mine." He looked at the red
west, and drew his plaid about him, and took firmer
clutch upon his staff. "But the lassie does not love
you?"</p>

<p>"My trust is that she may come to do so."</p>

<p>The elder got to his feet. Alexander rose also.</p>

<p>"It's coming night! Ye will be gaeing on over
the muir to the House?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Then, sir, I may come to White Farm, or
meet her when I may, and have my chance?"</p>

<p>"Aye. If so be I hear nae great thing against
ye. If so be ye're reasonable. If so be that in no
way do ye try to hurt the lassie."</p>

<p>"I'll be reasonable," said the laird of Glenfernie.
"And I'd not hurt Elspeth if I could!" His face
shone, his voice was a deep and happy music. He
was so bound, so at the feet of Elspeth, that he
could not but believe in joy and fortune. The sun
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>had dipped; the land lay dusk, but the sky was a
rose. There was a skimming of swallows overhead,
a singing of the wind in the ling. He walked with
White Farm to the foot of the moor, then said good
night and turned toward his own house.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>Two days later Alexander rode to Black Hill.
There had been in the night a storm with thunder
and lightning, wind and rain. Huge, ragged
banks of clouds yet hung sullen in the air, though
with lakes of blue between and shafts of sun. The
road was wet and shone. Now Black Alan must
pick his way, and now there held long stretches of
easy going. The old laird's quarrel with Mr. Archibald
Touris was not the young laird's. The old
laird's liking for Mrs. Alison was strongly the young
laird's. Glenfernie, in the months since his father's
death, had ridden often enough to Black Hill. Now
as he journeyed, together with the summer and
melody of his thoughts Elspeth-toward, he was
holding with himself a cogitation upon the subject
of Ian and Ian's last letter. He rode easily a powerful
steed, needing to be strong for so strongly built
a horseman. His riding-dress was blue; he wore his
own hair, unpowdered and gathered in a ribbon
beneath a three-cornered hat. There was perplexity
and trouble, too, in the Ian complex, but for all that
he rode with the color and sparkle of happiness in
his face. In his gray eyes light played to great
depths.</p>

<p>Black Hill appeared before him, the dark pine
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>and crag of the hill itself, and below that the house
with its far-stretching, well-planted policy. He
passed the gates, rode under the green elm boughs
of the avenue, and was presently before the porch
of the house. A man presented himself to take
Black Alan.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, there's company. Mr. Touris and
Mrs. Alison are with them in the gardens."</p>

<p>Glenfernie went there, passing by a terrace walk
around the house. Going under the windows of
the room that was yet Ian's when he came home.
Ian still in his mind, he recovered strongly the look
of that room the day Ian had taken him there, in
boyhood, when they first met. Out of that vividness
started a nucleus more vivid yet&mdash;the picture in the
book-closet of the city of refuge, and the silver goblet
drawn from the hidden shelf of the aumry. The
recaptured moment lost shape and color, returned
to the infinite past. He turned the corner of the
house and came into the gardens that Mr. Touris
had had laid out after the French style.</p>

<p>Here by the fountain he discovered the retired
merchant, and with him a guest, an old trade connection,
now a power in the East India Company.
The laird of Black Hill, a little more withered, a
little more stooped than of old, but still fluent,
caustic, and with now and then to the surface a
vague, cold froth of insincerity, made up much to
this magnate of commerce. He stood on his own
heath, or by his own fountain, but his neck had in
it a deferential crook. Lacs&mdash;rupees&mdash;factories&mdash;rajahs&mdash;ships&mdash;cottons&mdash;the
words fell like the
tinkle of a golden fountain. Listening to these two
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>stood, with his hands behind his back, Mr. Wotherspoon,
Black Hill's lawyer and man of business down
from Edinburgh. At a little distance Mrs. Alison
showed her roses to the wife of the East India man
and to a kinsman, Mr. Munro Touris, from Inverness
way.</p>

<p>Mr. Touris addressed himself with his careful
smile to Alexander. "Good day, Glenfernie! This,
Mr. Goodworth, is a good neighbor of mine, Mr.
Jardine of Glenfernie. Alexander, Mr. Goodworth
is art and part of the East India. You have met
Mr. Wotherspoon before, I think? There are Alison
and Mrs. Goodworth and Munro Touris by the
roses."</p>

<p>Glenfernie went over to the roses. Mrs. Alison,
smiling upon him, presented him to Mrs. Goodworth,
a dark, bright, black-eyed, talkative lady. He and
Munro Touris nodded to each other. The laird of
Black Hill, the India merchant, and the lawyer now
joined them, and all strolled together along the very
wide and straight graveled path. The talk was
chiefly upheld by Black Hill and the great trader,
with the lawyer putting in now and again a shrewd
word, and the trader's wife making aside to Mrs.
Alison an embroidery of comment. There had now
been left trade in excelsis and host and guests were
upon the state of the country, an unpopular war,
and fall of ministers. Came in phrases compounded
to meet Jacobite complications and dangers. The
Pretender&mdash;the Pretender and his son&mdash;French aid&mdash;French
army that might be sent to Scotland&mdash;position
of defense&mdash;rumors everywhere you go&mdash;disaffected
and Stewart-mad&mdash;. Munro Touris had
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>a biting word to say upon the Highland chiefs.
The lawyer talked of certain Lowland lords and
gentlemen. Mr. Touris vented a bitter gibe. He
had a black look in his small, sunken eyes. Alexander,
reading him, knew that he thought of Ian.
In a moment the whole conversation had dragged
that way. Mrs. Goodworth spoke with vivacity.</p>

<p>"Lord, sir! I hope that your nephew, now that
he wears the King's coat, has left off talking as he
did when he was a boy! He showed his Highland
strain with a warrant! You would have thought
that he had been <i>out</i> himself thirty years ago!"</p>

<p>Her husband checked her. "You have not seen
him since he was sixteen. Boys like that have wild
notions of romance and devotion. They change
when they're older."</p>

<p>The lawyer took the word. "Captain Rullock
doubtless buried all that years ago. His wearing
the King's coat hauds for proof."</p>

<p>Munro Touris had been college-mate in Edinburgh.
"He watered all that gunpowder in him
years ago, did he not, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>"'To water gunpowder&mdash;to shut off danger.'
That's a good figure of yours, Munro!" said Alexander.
Munro, who had been thought dull in the old
days, flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>They had come to a kind of summer-house overrun
with roses. Mr. Archibald Touris stopped short
and, with his back to this structure, faced the company
with him, brought thus to a halt. He looked
at them with a carefully composed countenance.</p>

<p>"I am sure, Munro, that Ian Rullock 'watered
the gunpowder,' as you cleverly say. Boys,
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>ma'am"&mdash;to Mrs. Goodworth&mdash;"are, as your husband
remarks, romantic simpletons. No one takes
them and their views of life seriously. Certainly
not their political views! When they come men
they laugh themselves. They are not boys then;
they are men. Which is, as it were, the preface to
what I might as well tell you. My nephew has resigned
his captaincy and quitted the army. Apparently
he has come to feel that soldiering is not,
after all, the life he prefers. It may be that he will
take to the law, or he may wander and then laird
it when I am gone. Or if he is very wise&mdash;I meant
to speak to you of this in private, Goodworth&mdash;he
might be furnished with shares and ventures in the
East India. He has great abilities."</p>

<p>"Well, India's the field!" said the London merchant,
placidly. "If a man has the mind and the
will he may make and keep and flourish and taste
power&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Left the King's forces!" cried Munro Touris.
"Why&mdash;! And will he be coming to Black Hill,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Next week. We have," said Mr. Touris,
and though he tried he could not keep the saturnine
out of his voice&mdash;"we have some things to talk
over."</p>

<p>As he spoke he moved from before the summer-house
into a cross-path, and the others followed him
and his Company magnate. The Edinburgh lawyer
and Glenfernie found themselves together. The
former lagged a step and held the younger man back
with him; he dropped his voice</p>

<p>"I've not been three hours in the house. I've
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>had no talk with Mr. Touris. What's all this
about? I know that you and his nephew are as
close as brothers&mdash;not that brothers are always
close!"</p>

<p>"He writes only that he is tired of martial life.
He has the soldier in him, but he has much besides.
That 'much besides' often steps in to change a
man's profession."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you'll persuade him to see the old
gunpowder very damp! I remember that, as a very
young man, he talked imprudently. But he has
been," said the lawyer, "far and wide since those
days."</p>

<p>"Yes, far and wide."</p>

<p>Mr. Wotherspoon with a long forefinger turned
a crimson rose seen in profile full toward him. "I
met him&mdash;once&mdash;when I was in London a year ago.
I had not seen him for years." He let the rose
swing back. "He has a magnificence! Do you know
I study a good deal? They say that so do you. I
have an inclination toward fifteenth-century Italian.
I should place him there." He spoke absently, still
staring at the rose. "A dash&mdash;not an ill dash, of
course&mdash;of what you might call the Borgia ... good
and evil tied into a sultry, thunderous splendor."</p>

<p>Glenfernie bent a keen look upon him out of
gray eyes. "An enemy might describe him so,
perhaps. I can see that such a one might do so."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're his friend!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Wotherspoon, straightening himself
from the contemplation of the roses, "there's
no greater thing than to have a steadfast friend!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>It seemed that an expedition had been planned,
for a servant now appeared to say that coach and
horses were at the door. Mr. Touris explained:</p>

<p>"I've engaged to show Mr. and Mrs. Goodworth
our considerable town. Mr. Wotherspoon, too, has
a moment's business there. Alison will not come,
but Munro Touris rides along. Will you come, too,
Glenfernie? We'll have a bit of dinner at the
'Glorious Occasion.'"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I have to get home presently.
But I'll stay a little and talk to Mrs. Alison, if I
may."</p>

<p>"Ah, you may!" said Mrs. Alison.</p>

<p>From the porch they watched the coach and four
away, with Munro Touris following on a strong and
ugly bay mare. The elm boughs of the avenue
hid the whole. The cloud continents and islands
were dissolving into the air ocean, the sun lay in
strong beams, the water drops were drying from leaf
and blade. Mrs. Alison and Alexander moved
through the great hall and down a corridor to a
little parlor that was hers alone. They entered
it. It gave, through an open door and two windows
set wide, upon a small, choice garden and one wide-spreading,
noble, ancient tree. Glenfernie entered as
one who knew the place, but upon whom, at every
coming, it struck with freshness and liking. The
room itself was most simple.</p>

<p>"I like," said Alexander, "our spare, clean, precise
Scotch parlors. But this is to me like a fine,
small prioress's room in a convent of learned saints!"</p>

<p>His old friend laughed. "Very little learned,
very little saintly, not at all prior! Let us sit in
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>the doorway, smell the lavender, and hear the linnets
in the tree."</p>

<p>She took the chair he pushed forward. He sat
upon the door-step at her feet.</p>

<p>"Concerning Ian," she said. "What do you make
out of it all?"</p>

<p>"I make out that I hope he'll not involve himself
in some French and Tory mad attempt!"</p>

<p>"What do his letters say?"</p>

<p>"They speak by indirection. Moreover, they're
at present few and short.... We shall see when he
comes!"</p>

<p>"Do you think that he will tell you all?"</p>

<p>Alexander's gray eyes glanced at her as earlier
they had glanced at Mr. Wotherspoon. "I do not
think that we keep much from each other!... No,
of course you are right! If there is anything that
in honor he cannot tell, or that I&mdash;with my pledges,
such as they are, in another urn&mdash;may not hear, we
shall find silences. I pin my trust to there being
nothing, after all!"</p>

<p>"The old wreath withered, and a new one better
woven and more evergreen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not know.... I said just now that Ian
and I kept little from each other. In an exceeding
great measure that is true. But there are huge
lands in every nature where even the oldest, closest,
sworn friend does not walk. It must be so. Friendship
is not falsified nor betrayed by its being so."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" said Mrs. Alison. "True friend or
lover loves that sense of the unplumbed, of the infinite,
in the cared-for one. To do else would be
to deny the unplumbed, the infinite, in himself, and
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>so the matching, the equaling, the <i>oneing</i> of love!"
She leaned forward in her chair; she regarded the
small, fragrant garden where every sweet and olden
flower seemed to bloom. "Now let us leave Ian,
and old, stanch, trusted, and trusting friendship.
It is part of oneness&mdash;it will be cared for!" She
turned her bright, calm gaze upon him. "What
other realm have you come into, Alexander? It was
plain the last time that you were here, but I did
not speak of it&mdash;it is plain to-day!" She laughed.
She had a silver, sweet, and merry laugh. "My dear,
there is a bloom and joy, a <i>vivification</i> about you that
may be felt ten feet away!" She looked at him with
affection and now seriously. "I know, I think, the
look of one who comes into spiritual treasures. This
is that and not that. It is the wilderness of lovely
flowers&mdash;hardly quite the music of the spheres! It
is not the mountain height, but the waving, leafy,
lower slopes&mdash;and yet we pass on to the height by
those slopes! Are you in love, Alexander?"</p>

<p>"You guess so much!" he said. "You have
guessed that, too. I do not care! I am glad that
the sun shines through me."</p>

<p>"You must be happy in your love! Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Elspeth Barrow, the granddaughter of Jarvis
Barrow of White Farm.... You say that I must
be happy in my love. The Lord of Heaven knows
that I am! and yet she is not yet sure that she
loves me in her turn. One might say that I had
great uncertainty of bliss. But I love so strongly
that I have no strength of disbelief in me!"</p>

<p>"Elspeth Barrow!"</p>

<p>"My old friend&mdash;the unworldliest, the better-<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>worldliest
soul I know&mdash;do not you join in that hue
and cry about world's gear and position! To be
Barrow is as good as to be Jardine. Elspeth is
Elspeth."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know why I made exclamation! Just the
old, dull earthy surprise! Wait for me a moment,
Alexander." She put her hands before her eyes,
then, dropping them, sat with her gaze upon the
great tree shot through with light from the clearing
sky. "I see her now. At first I could not disentangle
her and Gilian, for they were always together.
I have not seen them often&mdash;just three or
four times to remember, perhaps. But in April I
chanced for some reason to go to White Farm.... I
see her now! Yes, she has beauty, though it
would not strike many with the edge of the sword.... Yes,
I see&mdash;about the mouth and the eyes and
the set of the head. It's subtle&mdash;it's like some
pictures I remember in Italy. And intelligence is
there. Enchantment ... the more real, perhaps,
for not being the most obvious.... So you are enchained,
witched, held by the great sorceress!... Elspeth
is only one of her little names&mdash;her great
name is just love&mdash;love between man and woman.... Oh
yes, the whole of the sweetness is distilled
into one honey-drop&mdash;the whole giant thing is
shortened into one image&mdash;the whole heaven and
earth slip silkenly into one banner, and you would
die for it! You see, my dear," said Mrs. Alison,
who had never married, "I loved one who died. I
know."</p>

<p>Glenfernie took her hand and kissed it. "Nothing
is loss to you&mdash;nothing! For me, I am more
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>darkly made. So I hope to God I'll not lose Elspeth!"</p>

<p>Her tears, that were hardly of grief, dropped upon
his bent head. "Eh, my laddie! the old love is
there in the midst of the wide love. But the larger
controls.... Well, enough of that! And do you mean
that you have asked Elspeth to marry you&mdash;and
that she does not know her own heart?"</p>

<p>They talked, sitting before the fragrant garden,
in the little room that was tranquil, blissful, and
recluse. At last he rose.</p>

<p>"I must go."</p>

<p>They went out through the garden to the wicket
that parted her demesne from the formal, wide
pleasure-sweeps. He stopped for a moment under
the great tree.</p>

<p>"In a fortnight or so I must go to Edinburgh to
see Renwick about that land. And it is in my
mind to travel from there to London for a few
weeks. There are two or three persons whom I
know who could put a stout shoulder to the wheel
of Jamie's prospects. Word of mouth is better with
them than would be letters. Jamie is at Windsor.
I could take him with me here or there&mdash;give him,
doubtless, a little help."</p>

<p>"You are a world-man," said his friend, "which
is quite different from a worldly man! Come or
go as you will, still all is your garden that you cultivate....
Now you are thinking again of Elspeth!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps if for a month or two I plague her not,
then when I come again she may have a greater
knowledge of herself. Perhaps it is more generous
to be absent for a time&mdash;"</p>

<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>"I see that you will not doubt&mdash;that you cannot
doubt&mdash;that in the end she loves you!"</p>

<p>"Is it arrogance, self-love, and ignorance if I
think that? Or is it knowledge? I think it, and I
cannot and will not else!"</p>

<p>They came to the wicket, and stood there a moment
ere going on by the terrace to the front of
the house. The day was now clear and vivid, soft
and bright. The birds sang in a long ecstasy, the
flowers bloomed as though all life must be put into
June, the droning bees went about with the steadiest
preoccupation. Alexander looked about him.</p>

<p>"The earth is drunk with sweetness, and I see
now how great joy is sib to great pain!" He shook
himself. "Come back to earth and daylight, Alexander
Jardine!" He put a hand, large, strong, and
shapely, over Mrs. Alison's slender ivory one. "She,
too, has long fingers, though her hand is brown.
But it is an artist hand&mdash;a picture hand&mdash;a thoughtful
hand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Alison laughed, but her eyes were tender
over him. "Oh, man! what a great forest&mdash;what
an ever-rising song&mdash;is this same thing you're feeling!
And so old&mdash;and so fire-new!" They walked
along the terrace to the porch. "They're bringing
you Black Alan to ride away upon. But you'll come
again as soon as Ian's here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. You may be assured that if
he is free of that Stewart coil&mdash;or if he is in it only
so deep that he may yet free himself&mdash;I shall say
all that I can to keep him free or to urge him forth.
Not for much would I see Ian take ship in that
attempt!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>"No!... I have been reading the Book of Daniel.
Do you know what Ian is like to me? He is like
some great lord&mdash;a prince or governor&mdash;in the
court maybe of Belshazzar, or Darius the Mede,
or Cyrus the Persian&mdash;in that hot and stately land
of golden images and old rivers and the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer
and all kinds of music. He must serve his tyrant&mdash;and
yet Daniel, kneeling in his house, in his chamber,
with the windows open toward Jerusalem,
might hear a cry to hold his name in his prayers....
What strange thoughts we have of ourselves,
and of those nearest and dearest!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wotherspoon says that he is fifteenth-century
Italian. You have both done a proper bit
of characterization! But I," said Alexander, "I
know another great territory of Ian."</p>

<p>"I know that, Glenfernie! And so do I know
other good realms of Ian. Yet that was what I
thought when I read Daniel. And I had the
thought, too, that those old people were capable
of great friendships."</p>

<p>Black Alan was waiting. Glenfernie mounted,
said good-by again; the green boughs of the elm-trees
took him and his steed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>Ian forestalled Alexander, riding to Glenfernie
House the morning after his arrival at Black
Hill. "Let us go," he said, "where we can talk at
ease! The old, alchemical room?"</p>

<p>They crossed the grass-grown court to the keep,
entered and went up the broken stair to the stone-walled
chamber that took up the second floor, that
looked out of loophole windows north, south, east,
and west. The day was high summer, bright and
hot. Strong light and less strong light came in
beams from the four quarters and made in the large
place a conflict of light and shadow. The fireplace
was great enough for Gog and Magog to have warmed
themselves thereby. Around, in an orderly litter,
yet stood on table or bench or shelf many of the
matters that Alexander had gathered there in his
boyhood. In one corner was the furnace that when
he was sixteen his father had let him build. More
recent was the oaken table in the middle of the
room, two deep chairs, and shelves with many books.
After the warmth of the sun the place presented a
grave, cool, brown harbor.</p>

<p>The two, entering, had each an arm over the
other's shoulder. Where they were known their
friendship was famed. Youth and manhood, they
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>had been together when it was possible. When it
was not so the thought of each outtraveled separation.
Their differences, their varied colors of being,
seemed but to bind them closer. They entered
this room like David and Jonathan.</p>

<p>Ian also was tall, but not so largely made as was
the other. Lithe, embrowned, with gold-bronze
hair and eyes, knit of a piece, moving as by one undulation,
there was something in him not like the
Scot, something foreign, exotic. Sometimes Alexander
called him "Saracen"&mdash;a finding of the
imagination that dated from old days upon the
moor above the Kelpie's Pool when they read together
the <i>Faery Queen</i>. The other day, at Black
Hill, this ancient fancy had played through Alexander's
mind while Mr. Wotherspoon talked of
Italy, and Mrs. Alison of Babylonish lords.... The
point was that he relished Paynim knight and Renaissance
noble and prince of Babylon. Let Ian seem
or be all that, and richer yet! Still there would be
Ian, outside of all circles drawn.</p>

<p>In the room that he called the "alchemical,"
Ian, disengaging himself, turned and put both hands
on Alexander's shoulders. "Thou Old Steadfast!"
he cried. "God knows how glad I am to see thee!"</p>

<p>Alexander laughed. "Not more glad than I am
at the sight of you! What's the tidings?"</p>

<p>"What should they be? I am tired of being King
George's soldier!"</p>

<p>"So that you are tired of being any little king
of this earth's soldier!"</p>

<p>"Why, I think I am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kings 'over the water' included, Ian?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>"Kings without kingdoms? Well," said Ian,
"they don't amount to much, do they?"</p>

<p>"They do not." The two moved together to the
table and the chairs by it. "You are free of them,
Ian?"</p>

<p>"What is it to be free of them?"</p>

<p>"Well, to be plain, out of the Stewart cark and
moil! Pretender, Chevalier de St. George, or uncrowned
king&mdash;let it drift away like the dead leaf
it is!"</p>

<p>"A dead leaf. Is it a dead leaf?... I wonder!... But
you are usually right, old Steadfast!"</p>

<p>"I see that you will not tell me plainly."</p>

<p>"Are you so anxious? There is nothing to be
anxious about."</p>

<p>"Nothing.... What is 'nothing'?"</p>

<p>Ian drummed upon the table and whistled "Lillibullero."
"Something&mdash;nothing. Nothing&mdash;something!
Old Steadfast, you are a sight for sair een!
They say you make the best of lairds! Every cotter
sings of just ways!"</p>

<p>"My father was a good laird. I would not shatter
the tradition. Come with me to Edinburgh
and London, on that journey I wrote you of!"</p>

<p>"No. I want to sink into the summer green and
not raise my head from some old poetry book! I
have been marching and countermarching until I
am tired. As for what you have in your mind,
don't fash yourself about it! I will say that, at the
moment, I think it <i>is</i> a dead leaf.... Of course,
should the Pope's staff unexpectedly begin to bud
and flower&mdash;! But it mayn't&mdash;indeed, it only looks
at present smooth and polished and dead.... I left
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>the army because, naturally, I didn't want to be
there in case&mdash;just in case&mdash;the staff budded.
Heigho! It is the truth. You need not look
troubled," said Ian.</p>

<p>His friend must rest with that. He did so, and
put that matter aside. At any rate, things stood
there better than he had feared. "I shall be gone
a month or two. But you'll still be here when I
come home?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know I'll be here through the summer.
I have no plans.... If the leaf remains dry
and dead, what should you say to taking ship at
Leith in September for Holland? Amsterdam&mdash;then
Antwerp&mdash;then the Rhine. We might see the
great Frederick&mdash;push farther and look at the
Queen of Hungary."</p>

<p>"No, I may not. I look to be a home-staying
laird."</p>

<p>They sat with the table between them, and the
light from the four sides of the room rippled and
crossed over them. Books were on the table,
folios and volumes in less.</p>

<p>"The home-staying laird&mdash;the full scholar&mdash;at last
the writer&mdash;the master ... it is a good fortune!"</p>

<p>As Ian spoke he stretched his arms, he leaned
back in his chair and regarded the room, the fireplace,
the little furnace, and the shelves ranged with
the quaint, makeshift apparatuses of boyhood. He
looked at the green boughs without the loophole
windows and at the crossing lights and shadows,
and the brown books upon the brown table, and
at last, under somewhat lowered lids, at Alexander.
What moved in the bottom of his mind it would be
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>hard to say. He thought that he loved the man
sitting over against him, and so, surely, to some
great amount he did. But somewhere, in the thousand
valleys behind them, he had stayed in an inn
of malice and had carried hence poison in a vial
as small as a single cell. What suddenly made that
past to burn and set it in the present it were hard
to say. A spark perhaps of envy or of jealousy,
or a movement of contempt for Alexander's "fortune."
But he looked at his friend with half-closed
eyes, and under the sea of consciousness crawled,
half-blind, half-asleep, a willingness for Glenfernie
to find some thorn in life. The wish did not come
to consciousness. It was far down. He thought
of himself as steel true to Alexander. And in a
moment the old love drew again. He put out his
hands across the board. "When are we going to
see Mother Binning and to light the fire in the
cave?... There are not many like you, Alexander!
I'm glad to get back."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to have you back, old sworn-fellow,
old Saracen!"</p>

<p>They clasped hands. Gray eyes and brown eyes
with gold flecks met in a gaze that was as steady
with the one as with the other. It was Alexander
who first loosened handclasp.</p>

<p>They talked of affairs, particular and general,
of Ian's late proceedings and the lairdship of Alexander,
of men and places that they knew away from
this countryside. Ian watched the other as they
talked. Whatever there was that had moved,
down there in the abyss, was asleep again.</p>

<p>"Old Steadfast, you are ruddy and joyous! How
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>long since I was here, in the winter? Four months?
Well, you've changed. What is it?... Is it love?
Are you in love?"</p>

<p>"If I am&mdash;" Glenfernie rose and paced the
room. Coming to one of the narrow windows, he
stood and looked out and down upon bank and
brae and wood and field and moor. He returned
to the table. "I'll tell you about it."</p>

<p>He told. Ian sat and listened. The light played
about him, shook gold dots and lines over his green
coat, over his hands, his faintly smiling face, his
head held straight and high. He was so well to
look at, so "magnificent"! Alexander spoke with
the eloquence of a possessing passion, and Ian
listened and felt himself to be the sympathizing
friend. Even the profound, unreasonable, unhumorous
idealism of old Steadfast had its quaint, Utopian
appeal. He was going to marry the farmer's granddaughter,
though he might, undoubtedly, marry
better.... Ian listened, questioned, summed up:</p>

<p>"I have always been the worldly-wise one! Is
there any use in my talking now of worldly wisdom?"</p>

<p>"No use at all."</p>

<p>"Then I won't!... Old Alexander the Great, are
you happy?"</p>

<p>"If she gives me her love."</p>

<p>Ian dismissed that with a wave of his hand.
"Oh, I think she'll give it, dear simpleton!" He
looked at Glenfernie now with genial affection.
"Well, on the whole, and balancing one thing
against another, I think that I want you to be
happy!"</p>

<p>Alexander laughed at that minification. "And
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>my happiness is big enough&mdash;or if I get it it will be
big enough&mdash;not in the least to disturb our friendship
country, Ian!"</p>

<p>"I'll believe that, too. Our relations are old and
rooted."</p>

<p>"Old and rooted."</p>

<p>"So I wish you joy.... And I remember when you
thought you would not marry!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;memories! I'm sweeping them away! I'm
beginning again!... I hold fast the memory of
friendship. I hold fast the memory that somehow,
in this form or that, I must have loved her from the
beginning of things!" He rose and moved about
the room. Going to the fireplace, he leaned his
forehead against the stone and looked down at the
laid, not kindled, wood. He turned and came back
to Ian. "The world seems to me all good."</p>

<p>Ian laughed at him, half in raillery, but half in
a flood of kindness. If what had stirred had been
ancient betrayal, alive and vital one knew not when,
now again it was dead, dead. He rose, he put his
arm again about Alexander's shoulder. "Glenfernie!
Glenfernie! you're in deep! Well, I hope the world
will stay heaven, e'en for your sake!"</p>

<p>They left the old room with its hauntings of a
boy's search for gold, with, back of that, who might
know what hauntings of ancient times and fortress
doings, violences and agonies, subduings, revivings,
cark and care and light struggling through, dark
nights and waited-for dawns! They went down the
stair and out of the keep. Late June flamed around
them.</p>

<p>Ian stayed another hour or two ere he rode back
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>to Black Hill. With Glenfernie he went over Glenfernie
House, the known, familiar rooms. They
went to the school-room together and out through
the breach in the old castle wall, and sat among
the pine roots, and looked down through leafy tree-tops
to the glint of water. When, in the sun-washed
house and narrow garden and grassy court, they
came upon men and women they stopped and spoke,
and all was friendly and merry as it should be in a
land of good folk. Ian had his crack with Davie,
with Eppie and Phemie and old Lauchlinson and
others. They sat for a few minutes with Mrs. Grizel
where, in a most housewifely corner, she measured
currants and bargained with pickers of cherries.
Strickland they came upon in the book-room. With
the Jardines and this gentleman the sense of employed
and employee had long ago passed into a
larger inclusion. He and the young laird talked and
worked together as members of one family. Now
there was some converse among the three, and then
the two left Strickland in the cool, dusky room.
Outside the house June flamed again. For a while
they paced up and down under the trees in the
narrow garden atop the craggy height. Then Ian
mounted Fatima, who all these years was kept for
him at Black Hill.</p>

<p>"You'll come over to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Glenfernie watched him down the steep-descending,
winding road, and thought of many roads that,
good company, he and Ian had traveled together.</p>

<p>This was the middle of the day. In the afternoon
he walked to White Farm.... It was sunset
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>when he turned his face homeward. He looked back
and saw Elspeth at the stepping-stones, in a clear
flame of golden sky and golden water. She had
seemed kind; he walked on air, his hand in Hope's.
Hope had well-nigh the look of Assurance. He was
going away because it was promised and arranged
for and he must go. But he was coming again&mdash;he
was coming again.</p>

<p>A golden moon rose through the clear east. He
was in no hurry to reach Glenfernie House. The
aching, panting bliss that he felt, the energy compressed,
held back, straining at the leash, wanted
night and isolation. So it could better dream of
day and the clasp of that other that with him
would make one. Now he walked and now stood,
his eyes upon the mounting orb or the greater stars
that it could not dim, and now he stretched himself
in the summer heath. At last, not far from midnight,
he came to that face of Glenfernie Hill below
the old wall, to the home stream and the bit of
thick wood where once, in boyhood, he had lain
with covered face under the trees and little by little
had put from his mind "The Cranes of Ibycus."
The moonlight was all broken here. Shafts of black
and white lay inextricably crossed and mingled.
Alexander passed through the little wood and
climbed, with the secure step of old habit, the
steep, rough path to the pine without the wall,
there stooped and came through the broken wall to
the moon-silvered court, and so to the door left open
for him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>The laird of Glenfernie was away to Edinburgh
on Black Alan, Tam Dickson with him on
Whitefoot. Ian Rullock riding Fatima, behind him
a Black Hill groom on an iron-gray, came over the
moor to the head of the glen. Ian checked the
mare. Behind him rolled the moor, with the hollow
where lay, water in a deep jade cup, the Kelpie's
Pool. Before him struck down the green feathered
cleft, opening out at last into the vale. He could see
the water there, and a silver gleam that was White
Farm. He sat for a minute, pondering whether he
should ride back the way he had come or, giving
Fatima to Peter Lindsay, walk through the glen.
He looked at his watch, looked, too, at a heap of
clouds along the western horizon. The gleam in the
vale at last decided him. He left the saddle.</p>

<p>"Take Fatima around to White Farm, Lindsay.
I'll walk through the glen." His thought was, "I
might as well see what like is Alexander's inamorata!"
It was true that he had seen her quite long
ago, but time had overlaid the image, or perhaps he
had never paid especial note.</p>

<p>Peter Lindsay stooped to catch the reins that the
other tossed him. "There's weather in thae clouds,
sir!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>"Not before night, I think. They're moving very
slowly."</p>

<p>Lindsay turned with the horses. Ian, light of
step, resilient, "magnificent," turned from the purple
moor into the shade of birches. A few moments
and he was near the cot of Mother Binning. A
cock crowed, a feather of blue smoke went up from
her peat fire.</p>

<p>He came to her door, meaning to stay but for a
good-natured five minutes of gossip. She had lived
here forever, set in the picture with ash-tree and
boulder. But when he came to the door he found
sitting with her, in the checkered space behind the
opening, Glenfernie's inamorata.</p>

<p>Now he remembered her.... He wondered if he
had truly ever forgotten her.</p>

<p>When he had received his welcome he sat down
upon the door-step. He could have touched Elspeth's
skirt. When she lowered her eyes they
rested upon his gold-brown head, upon his hand in
a little pool of light.</p>

<p>"Eh, laddie!" said Mother Binning, "but ye grow
mair braw each time ye come!"</p>

<p>Elspeth thought him braw. The wishing-green
where they danced, hand in hand!... Now she knew&mdash;now
she knew&mdash;why her heart had lain so cold
and still&mdash;for months, for years, cold and still!
That was what hearts did until the sun came....
Definitely, in this hour, for her now, upon this
stretch of the mortal path, Ian became the sun.</p>

<p>Ian sat daffing, talking. The old woman listened,
her wheel idle; the young woman listened. The
young woman, sitting half in shadow, half in light,
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>put up her hand and drew farther over her face the
brim of her wide hat of country weave. She wished
to hide her eyes, her lips. She sat there pale, and
through her ran in fine, innumerable waves human
passion and longing, wild courage and trembling
humility.</p>

<p>The sunlight that flooded the door-stone and
patched the cottage floor began to lessen and withdraw.
Low and distant there sounded a roll of
thunder. Jock Binning came upon his crutches
from the bench by the stream where he made a
fishing-net.</p>

<p>"A tempest's daundering up!"</p>

<p>Elspeth rose. "I must go home&mdash;I must get
home before it comes!"</p>

<p>"If ye'll bide, lassie, it may go by."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot." She had brought to Mother
Binning a basket heaped with bloomy plums. She
took it up and set it on the table. "I'll get the
basket when next I come. Now I must go! Hark,
there's the thunder again!"</p>

<p>Ian had risen also. "I will go with you. Yes!
It was my purpose to walk through to White Farm.
I sent Fatima around with Peter Lindsay."</p>

<p>As they passed the ash-tree there was lightning,
but yet the heavens showed great lakes of blue, and
a broken sunlight lay upon the path.</p>

<p>"There's time enough! We need not go too fast.
The path is rough for that."</p>

<p>They walked in silence, now side by side, now,
where the way was narrow, one before the other.
The blue clouded over, there sprang a wind. The
trees bent and shook, the deep glen grew gray and
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>dark. That wind died and there was a breathless
stillness, heated and heavy. Each heard the other's
breathing as they walked.</p>

<p>"Let us go more quickly! We have a long way."</p>

<p>"Will you go back to Mother Binning's?"</p>

<p>"That, too, is far."</p>

<p>They had passed the cave a little way and were
in mid-glen. It was dusk in this narrow pass. The
trees hung, shadows in a brooding twilight; between
the close-set pillars of the hills the sky showed
slate-hued, with pallid feathers of cloud driven across.
Lightning tore it, the thunder was loud, the trees
upon the hilltops began to move. Some raindrops
fell, large, slow, and warm. The lightning ran
again, blindingly bright; the ensuing thunderclap
seemed to shake the rock. As it died, the cataract
sound of the wind was heard among the ranked
trees. The drops came faster, came fast.</p>

<p>"It's no use!" cried Ian. "You'll be drenched
and blinded! There's danger, too, in these tall
trees. Come back to the cave and take shelter!"</p>

<p>He turned. She followed him, breathless, liking
the storm&mdash;so that no bolt struck him. In every
nerve, in every vein, she felt life rouse itself. It
was like day to old night, summer to one born in
winter, a passion of revival where she had not
known that there was anything to revive. The past
was as it were not, the future was as it were not;
all things poured into a tremendous present. It
was proper that there should be storm without, if
within was to be this enormous, aching, happy
tumult that was pain indeed, but pain that one
would not spare!</p>

<p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>Ian parted the swinging briers. They entered
the cavern. If it was dim outside in the glen, it
was dimmer here. Then the lightning flashed and
all was lit. It vanished, the light from the air in
conflict with itself. All was dark&mdash;then the flash
again! The rain now fell in a torrent.</p>

<p>"At least it is dry here! There is wood, but I
have no way to make fire."</p>

<p>"I am not cold."</p>

<p>"Sit here, upon this ledge. Alexander and I
cleared it and widened it."</p>

<p>She sat down. When he spoke of Alexander she
thought of Alexander, without unkindness, without
comparing, without compunction, a thought colorless
and simple, as of one whom she had known and
liked a long time ago. Indeed, it might be said
that she had little here with which to reproach herself.
She had been honest&mdash;had not said "Take!"
where she could not fulfil.... And now the laird
of Glenfernie was like a form met long ago&mdash;long
ago! It seemed so long and far away that she
could not even think of him as suffering. As she
might leave a fugitive memory, so she turned her
mind from him.</p>

<p>Ian thought of Alexander ... but he looked, by
the lightning's lamp, at the woman opposite.</p>

<p>She was not the first that he had desired, but he
desired now with unwonted strength. He did not
know why&mdash;he did not analyze himself nor the
situation&mdash;but all the others seemed gathered up
in her. She was fair to him, desirable!... He
thirsted, quite with the mortal honesty of an Arab,
day and night and day again without drink in the
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>desert, and the oasis palms seen at last on the
horizon. In his self-direction thitherward he was
as candid, one-pointed, and ruthless as the Arab
might be. He had no deliberate thought of harm
to the woman before him&mdash;as little as the Arab
would have of hurting the well whose cool wave
seemed to like the lip touch. Perhaps he as little
stopped to reason as would have done the Arab.
Perhaps he had no thought of deeply injuring a
friend. If there were two desert-traversers, or more
than two, making for the well, friendship would not
hold one back, push another forward. Race!&mdash;and
if the well was but to one, then let fate and Allah
approve the swiftest! Under such circumstances
would not Alexander outdo him if he might? He
was willing to believe so. Glenfernie said himself
that the girl did not know if she cared for him. If,
then, the well was not for him, anyway?... <i>Where
was the wrong?</i> Now Ian believed in his own power
and easy might and pleasantness and, on the whole,
goodness&mdash;believed, too, in the love of Alexander
for him, love that he had tried before, and it held.
<i>And if he made love to Elspeth Barrow need old
Steadfast ever know it?</i> And, finally, and perhaps,
unacknowledged to himself, from the first, he turned
to that cabinet of his heart where was the vial
made of pride, that held the drop of malice. The
storm continued. They looked through the portcullis
made by the briers upon a world of rain.
The lightning flashed, the thunder rolled; in here
was the castle hold, dim and safe. They were as
alone as in a fairy-tale, as alone as though around
the cave beat an ocean that boat had never crossed.</p>

<p><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>They sat near each other; once or twice Ian, rising,
moved to and fro in the cave, or at the opening
looked into the turmoil without. When he did this
her eyes followed him. Each, in every fiber, had
consciousness of the other. They were as conscious
of each other as lion and lioness in a desert cave.</p>

<p>They talked, but they did not talk much. What
they said was trite enough. Underneath was the
potent language, wave meeting wave with shock
and thrill and exultation. These would not come,
here and now, to outer utterance. But sooner or
later they would come. Each knew that&mdash;though
not always does one acknowledge what is known.</p>

<p>When they spoke it was chiefly of weather and
of country people....</p>

<p>The lightning blazed less frequently, thunder subdued
itself. For a time the rain fell thick and
leaden, but after an hour it thinned and grew silver.
Presently it wholly stopped.</p>

<p>"This storm is over," said Ian.</p>

<p>Elspeth rose from the ledge of stone. He drew
aside the dripping curtain of leaf and stem, and she
stepped forth from the cave, and he followed. The
clouds were breaking, the birds were singing. The
day of creation could not have seen the glen more
lucent and fragrant. When, soon, they came to its
lower reaches, with White Farm before them, they
saw overhead a rainbow.</p>

<hr style='width: 33%;' />

<p>The day of the storm and the cave was over, but
with no outward word their inner selves had covenanted
to meet again. They met in the leafy glen.
It was easy for her to find an errand to Mother
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>Binning's, or, even, in the long summer afternoons,
to wander forth from White Farm unquestioned.
As for him, he came over the moor, avoided the cot
at the glen head, and plunged down the steep hillside
below. Once they met Jock Binning in the
glen. After that they chose for their trysting-place
that green hidden arm that once she and the laird
of Glenfernie had entered.</p>

<p>Elspeth did not think in those days; she loved.
She moved as one who is moved; she was drawn
as by the cords of the sun. The Ancient One, the
Sphinx, had her fast. The reflection of a greater
thing claimed her and taught her, held her like a
bayadere in a temple court.</p>

<p>As for Ian, he also held that he loved. He was
the Arab bound for the well for which he thirsted,
single-minded as to that, and without much present
consciousness of tarnish or sin.... But what might
arise in his mind when his thirst was quenched?
Ian did not care, in these blissful days, to think of
that.</p>

<p>He had come on the day of the storm, the cave,
and the rainbow to a fatal place in his very long
life. He was upon very still, deep water, glasslike,
with only vague threads and tremors to show what
might issue in resistless currents. He had been in
such a place, in his planetary life, over and over and
over again. This concatenation had formed it, or
that concatenation; the surrounding phenomena
varied, but essentially it was always the same, like
a dream place. The question was, would he turn
his boat, or raft, or whatever was beneath him, or
his own stroke as swimmer, and escape from this
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>glassy place whose currents were yet but tendrils?
He could do it; it was the Valley of Decision....
But so often, in all those lives whose bitter and
sweet were distilled into this one, he had not done
it. It had grown much easier not to do it. Sometimes
it had been illusory love, sometimes ambition,
sometimes towering pride and self-seeking, sometimes
mere indolent unreadiness, dreamy self-will.
On he had gone out of the lower end of the Valley
of Decision, where the tendrils became arms of
giants and decisions might no longer be made.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>The laird of Glenfernie stayed longer from home
than, riding away, he had expected to do. It
was the latter half of August when he and Black
Alan, Tam Dickson and Whitefoot, came up the
winding road to Glenfernie door. Phemie it was,
at the clothes-lines, who noted them on the lowest
spiral, who turned and ran and informed the household.
"The laird's coming! The laird's coming!"
Men and women and dogs began to stir.</p>

<p>Strickland, looking from the window of his own
high room, saw the riders in and out of the bronzing
woods. Descending, he joined Mrs. Grizel upon the
wide stone step without the hall door. Davie was
in waiting, and a stable-boy or two came at a run.</p>

<p>"Two months!" said Mrs. Grizel. "But it used
to be six months, a year, two years, and more! He
grows a home body, as lairds ought to be!"</p>

<p>Alexander dismounted at the door, took her in
his arms and kissed her twice, shook hands with
Strickland, greeted Davie and the men. "How
good it is to get home! I've pined like a lost bairn.
And none of you look older&mdash;Aunt Grizel hasn't a
single white hair!"</p>

<p>"Go along with you, laddie!" said Aunt Grizel.
"You haven't been so long away!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>The sun was half-way down the western quarter.
He changed his riding-clothes, and they set food
for him in the hall. He ate, and Davie drew the
cloth and brought wine and glasses. Some matter
or other called Mrs. Grizel away, but Strickland
stayed and drank wine with him.</p>

<p>Questions and answers had been exchanged.
Glenfernie gave in detail reasons for his lengthened
stay. There had been a business postponement
and complication&mdash;in London Jamie's affairs; again,
in Edinburgh, insistence of kindred with whom
Alice was blooming, "growing a fine lady, too!"
and at the last a sudden and for a while dangerous
sickness of Tam Dickson's that had kept them
a week at an inn a dozen miles this side of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>"Each time I started up sprang a stout hedge!
But they're all down now and here I am!" He
raised his wine-glass. "To home, and the sweetness
thereof!" said Alexander.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you back," said Strickland, and
meant it.</p>

<p>The late sunlight streamed through the open door.
Bran, the old hound, basked in it; it wiped the rust
from the ancient weapons on the wall and wrote
hieroglyphics in among them; it made glow the wine
in the glass. Alexander turned in his chair.</p>

<p>"It's near sunset.... Now what, just, did you
hear about Ian Rullock's going?"</p>

<p>"We supposed that he would be here through the
autumn&mdash;certainly until after your return. Then,
three days ago, comes Peter Lindsay with the note
for you, and word that he was gone. Lindsay
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>thought that he had received letters from great
people and had gone to them for a visit."</p>

<p>Alexander spread the missive that had been given
him upon the table. "It's short!" He held it so
that Strickland might read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Glenfernie</span>,&mdash;Perhaps the leaf is not yet wholly sere. Be
that as it may be, I'm leaving Black Hill for a time.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Ian Rullock</span>.</p></div>

<p>"That's a puzzling billet!" said Alexander. "'<i>Glenfernie</i>&mdash;<i>Ian
Rullock!</i>'"</p>

<p>"What does he mean by the leaf not dead?"</p>

<p>"That was a figure of speech used between us
in regard to a certain thing.... Well, he also has
moods! It is my trust that he has not answered
to some one's piping that the leaf's not dead! That
is the likeliest thing&mdash;that he answered and has
gone. I'll ride to Black Hill to-morrow." The sun
set, twilight passed, candles were lighted. "Have
you seen any from White Farm?"</p>

<p>"I walked there from Littlefarm with Robin
Greenlaw. Jarvis Barrow was reading Leviticus,
looking like a listener in the Plain of Sinai. They
expected Gilian home from Aberdeen. They say
the harvest everywhere is good."</p>

<p>Alexander asked no further and presently they
parted for the night. The laird of Glenfernie looked
from his chamber window, and he looked toward
White Farm. It was dark, clear night, and all the
autumn stars shone like worlds of hope.</p>

<p>The next morning he mounted his horse and went
off to Black Hill. He would get this matter of Ian
straight. It was early when he rode, and he came
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>to Black Hill to find Mr. Touris and his sister yet
at the breakfast-table. Mrs. Alison, who might
have been up hours, sat over against a dour-looking
master of the house who sipped his tea and crumbled
his toast and had few good words for anything.
But he was glad and said that he was glad to see
Glenfernie.</p>

<p>"Now, maybe, we'll have some light on Ian's
doings!"</p>

<p>"I came for light to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he hasn't written you?"</p>

<p>"Only a line that I found waiting for me. It
says, simply, that he leaves Black Hill for a while."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't get light from me! My light's
darkness. The women found in his room a memorandum
of ships and two addresses, one a house
in Amsterdam, and one, if you please, in Paris&mdash;<i>Faubourg
Saint-Germain!</i>"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he left without explanation
or good-by?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Alison spoke. "No, Archibald does not
mean that. One evening Ian outdid himself in
bonniness and golden talk. Then as we took our
candles he told us that the wander-fever had him
and that he would be riding to Edinburgh. Archibald
protested, but he daffed it by. So the next
day he went, and he may be in Edinburgh. It
would seem nothing, if these Highland chiefs were
not his kin and if there wasn't this round and round
rumor of the Pretender and the French army! There
may be nothing&mdash;he may be riding back almost to-morrow!"</p>

<p>But Mr. Touris would not shake the black dog from
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>his shoulders. "He'll bring trouble yet&mdash;was born
the sort to do it!"</p>

<p>Alexander defended him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're his friend&mdash;sworn for thick and thin!
As for Alison, she'd find a good word for the fiend
from hell!&mdash;not that my sister's son is anything
of that," said the Scotchman. "But he'll bring
trouble to warm, canny, king-and-kirk-abiding folk!
He's an Indian macaw in a dove-cote."</p>

<p>They rose from table. Out on the terrace they
walked up and down in the soft, bright morning
light. Mr. Touris seemed to wish company; he
clung to Glenfernie until the latter must mount his
horse and ride home. Only for a moment did
Alexander and Mrs. Alison have speech together.</p>

<p>"When will you be seeing Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"I hope this afternoon."</p>

<p>"May joy come to you, Alexander!"</p>

<p>"I want it to come. I want it to come."</p>

<p>He and Black Alan journeyed home. As he rode
he thought now and again of Ian, perhaps in Edinburgh
according to his word of mouth, but perhaps,
despite that word, on board some ship that should
place him in the Low Countries, from which he might
travel into France and to Paris and that group of
Jacobites humming like a byke of bees around a
prince, the heir of all the Stewarts. He thought
with old affection and old concern. Whatever Ian
did&mdash;intrigued with Jacobite interest or held aloof
like a sensible man&mdash;yet was he Ian with the old
appeal. <i>Take me or leave me&mdash;me and my dusky gold!</i>
Alexander drew a deep breath, shook his shoulders,
raised his head. "Let my friend be as he is!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>He ceased to think of Ian and turned to the
oncoming afternoon&mdash;the afternoon rainbow-hued,
coming on to the sound of music.</p>

<p>Again in his own house, he and Strickland worked
an hour or more upon estate business. That over
and dinner past, he went to the room in the keep.
When the hour struck three he passed out of the
opening in the old wall, clambered down the bank,
and, going through the wood, took his way to
White Farm.</p>

<p>Just one foreground wish in his mind was granted.
There was an orchard strip by White Farm, and
here, beneath a red-apple tree, he found Elspeth
alone. She was perfectly direct with him.</p>

<p>"Willy told us that you were home. I thought
you might come now to White Farm. I was watching.
I wanted to speak to you where none was by.
Let us cross the burn and walk in the fields."</p>

<p>The fields were reaped, lay in tawny stubble.
The path ran by this and by a lichened stone wall.
Overhead, swallows were skimming. Heath and
bracken, rolled the colored hills. The air swam cool
and golden, with a smell of the harvest earth.</p>

<p>"Elspeth, I stayed away years and years and
years, and I stayed away not one hour!"</p>

<p>She stopped; she stood with her back to the
wall. The farm-house had sunk from sight, the
sun was westering, the fields lay dim gold and solitary.
She had over her head a silken scarf, the
ends of which she drew together and held with one
brown, slender hand against her breast. She wore
a dark gown; he saw her bosom rise and fall.</p>

<p>"I watched for you to tell you that this must not
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>go on any longer. I came to my mind when you
were gone, Mr. Alexander&mdash;I came to my mind! I
think that you are braw and noble, but in the way
of loving, as love is between man and woman, I
have none for you&mdash;I have none for you!"</p>

<p>The sun appeared to dip, the fields to darken.
Pain came to Glenfernie, wildering and blinding.
He stood silent.</p>

<p>"I might have known before you went&mdash;I might
have known from that first meeting, in May, in the
glen! But I was a fool, and vague, and willing, I
suppose, to put tip of tongue to a land of sweetness!
If, mistaken myself, I helped you to mistake, I am
bitter sorry and I ask your forgiveness! But the
thing, Glenfernie, the thing stands! It's for us to
part."</p>

<p>He stared at her dumbly. In every line of her,
in every tone of her, there was finality. He was
tenacious of purpose, capable of long-sustained and
patient effort, but he seemed to know that, for this
life, purpose and effort here might as well be laid
aside. The knowledge wrapped him, quiet, gray,
and utter. He put his hands to his brow; he
moved a few steps to and fro; he came to the wall
and leaned against it. It seemed to him that he
regarded the clay-cold corpse of his life.</p>

<p>"O the world!" cried Elspeth. "When we are
little it seems so little! If you suffer, I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Present suffering may be faced if there's light
behind."</p>

<p>"There's not this light, Glenfernie.... O world!
if there is some other light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And time will do naught for me, Elspeth?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>"No. Time will do naught for you. It is over!
And the day goes down and the world spins on."</p>

<p>They stood apart, without speaking, under their
hands the heaped stones of the wall. The swallows
skimmed; a tinkling of sheep-bells was heard; the
stubble and the moor beyond the fields lay in gold,
in sunken green and violet; the hilltops met the sky
in a line long, clean, remote, and still. Elspeth
spoke.</p>

<p>"I am going now, back home. Let's say good-by
here, each wishing the other some good in, or maybe
out of, this carefu' world!"</p>

<p>"You, also, are unhappy. Why?"</p>

<p>"I am not! Do I seem so? I am sorry for unhappiness&mdash;that
is all! Of course we grow older,"
said Elspeth, "older and wiser. But you nor no
one must think that I am unhappy! For I am not."
She put out her hands to him. "Let us say good-by!"</p>

<p>"Is it so? Is it so?"</p>

<p>"Never make doubt of that! I want you to see
that it is clean snapped&mdash;clean gone!"</p>

<p>She gave him her hands. They lay in his grasp
untrembling, filled with a gathered strength. He
wrung them, bowed his head upon them, let them go.
They fell at her sides; then she raised them, drew
the scarf over her head and, holding it as before,
turned and went away up the path between the yellow
stubble and the wall. She walked quickly, dark
clad; she was gone like a bird into a wood, like a
branch of autumn leaves when the sea fog rolls in.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie turned to his ancient
house on the craggy hill.... That night he made
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>him a fire in his old loved room in the keep. He
sat beside it; he lighted candles and opened books,
and now and then he sat so still before them that he
may have thought that he read. But the books
slipped away, and the candles guttered down, and
the fire went out. At last, in the thick darkness,
he spread his arms upon the table and bowed his
head in them, and his frame shook with a man's
slow weeping.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>The bright autumn sank into November, November
winds and mists into a muffled, gray-roofed,
white-floored December. And still the laird of Glenfernie
lived with the work of the estate and, when
that was done, and when the long, lonely, rambling
daily walk or ride was over, with books. The room
in the keep had now many books. He sat among
them, and he built his fire higher, and his candles
burned into late night. Whether he read or did not
read, he stayed among them and drew what restless
comfort he might. Strickland, from his own high
room, waking in the night, saw the loophole slit of
light.</p>

<p>He felt concern. The change that had come to
his old pupil was marked enough. Strickland's
mind dwelt on the old laird. Was that the personality,
not of one, but of two, of the whole line,
perhaps, developing all the time, step by step with
what seemed the plastic, otherwise, free time of
youth, appearing always in due season, when its
hour struck? Would Alexander, with minor differences,
repeat his father? How of the mother?
Would the father drown the mother? In the enormous
all-one, the huge blend, what would arrive?
Out of all fathers and mothers, out of all causes?</p>

<p><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>It could not be said that Alexander was surly.
Nor, if the weather was dark with him, that he tried
to shake his darkness into others' skies. Nor that
he meanly succumbed to the weight, whatever it
was, that bore upon him. He did his work, and
achieved at least the show of equanimity. Strickland
wondered. What was it that had happened?
It never occurred to him that it had happened here
in this dale. But in all that life of Alexander's in
the wider world there must needs have been relationships
of lands established. Somewhere, something
had happened to overcloud his day, to uncover ancestral
resemblances, possibilities. Something, somewhere,
and he had had news of it this autumn....
It happened that Strickland had never seen Glenfernie
with Elspeth Barrow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grizel was not observant. So that her
nephew came to breakfast, dinner, and supper, so
that he was not averse to casual speech of household
interests, so that he seemed to keep his health,
so that he gave her now and then words and a kiss
of affection, she was willing to believe that persons
addicted to books and the company of themselves
had a right to stillness and gravity. Alice stayed
in Edinburgh; Jamie soldiered it in Flanders.
Strickland wrote and computed for and with the
laird, then watched him forth, a solitary figure,
by the fir-trees, by the leafless trees, and down the
circling road into the winter country. Or he saw
firelight in the keep and knew that Alexander
walked to and fro, to and fro, or sat bowed over a
book. Late at night, waking, he saw that Glenfernie
still watched.</p>

<p><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>It was not Ian Rullock nor anything to do with
him that had helped on this sharp alteration, this
turn into some Cimmerian stretch of the mind's
or the emotions' vast landscape. If Strickland had
at first wondered if this might be the case, the
thought vanished. Glenfernie, free to speak of Ian,
spoke freely, with the relief of there, at least, a sunny
day. It somewhat amazed and disquieted, even
while it touched, the older man of quiet passions
and even ways, the old strength of this friendship.
Glenfernie seemed to brood with a mother-passion
over Ian. To an extent here he confided in Strickland.
The latter knew of the worry about Jacobite
plots and the drawing of Ian into that vortex&mdash;Ian
known now to be in Paris, writing thence twice or
thrice during this autumn and early winter, letters
that came to Glenfernie's hand by unusual channels,
smacking all of them of Jacobite or High
Tory transmissals. Strickland did not see these
letters. Of them Alexander said only that Ian
wrote as usual, except that he made no reference
to sere leaves turning green or a dead staff
budding.</p>

<p>In the room with only the loophole windows, by
the firelight, Alexander read over again the second
of these letters. "So you have loved and lost, old
Steadfast? Let it not grieve you too much!" And
that was all of that. And it pleased Alexander that
it was all. Ian was too wise to touch and finger
the heart. Ian, Ian, rich and deep and himself almost!
Ten thousand Ian recollections pressed in
upon Alexander. Let Ian, an he would, go a-lusting
after old dynasties! Yet was he Ian! In these
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>months it was Ian memories that chiefly gave
Alexander comfort.</p>

<p>They gave beyond what, at this time, Mrs. Alison
could give. At considerable intervals he went
to Black Hill. But his old friend lived in a rare,
upland air, and he could not yet find rest in her
clime. She saw that.</p>

<p>"It's for after a while, isn't it, Alexander? Oh,
after a while you'll see that it is the breathing, living
air! But do not feel now that you are in duty
bound to come here. Wait until you feel like
coming, and never think that I'll be hurt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am a marsh thing," he said. "I feel dull and
still and cold, and over me is a heavy atmosphere
filled with motes. Forgive me and let me come to
you farther on and higher up."</p>

<p>He went back to the gray crag, Glenfernie House
and the room in the keep, the fire and his books,
and a brooding traveling over the past, and, like a
pool of gold in a long arctic night, the image, nested
and warm, of Ian. Love was lost, but there stayed
the ancient, ancient friend.</p>

<p>Two weeks before Christmas Alice came home,
bright as a rose. She talked of a thousand events,
large and small. Glenfernie listened, smiled, asked
questions, praised her, and said it was good to have
brightness in the house.</p>

<p>"Aye, it is!" she answered. "How grave and old
you and Mr. Strickland and the books and the hall
and Bran look!"</p>

<p>"It's heigho! for Jamie, isn't it?" asked Alexander.
"Winter makes us look old. Wait till
springtime!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>That evening she waylaid Strickland. "What is
the matter with Alexander?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"He looks five years older. He looks as though
he had been through wars."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has. I don't know what it is," said
Strickland, soberly.</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Alice&mdash;"do you think he
could have had&mdash;oh, somewhere out in the world!&mdash;a
love-affair, and it ended badly? She died, or
there was a rival, or something like that, and he
has just heard of it?"</p>

<p>"You have been reading novels," said Strickland.
"And yet&mdash;!"</p>

<p>That night, seeing from his own window the light
in the keep, he turned to his bed with the thought
of the havoc of love. Lying there with open eyes
he saw in procession Unhappy Love. He lay long
awake, but at last he turned and addressed himself
to sleep. "He's a strong climber! Whatever it is,
maybe he'll climb out of it."</p>

<p>But in the keep, Alexander, sitting by the fire
with lowered head and hanging hands, saw not the
time when he would climb out of it....</p>

<p>He went no more to White Farm. He went,
though not every Sunday, to kirk and sat with his
aunt and with Strickland in the laird's boxlike,
curtained pew. Mr. M'Nab preached of original
sin and ineffable condemnation, and of the few, the
very, very few, saved as by fire. He saw Jarvis
Barrow sitting motionless, sternly agreeing, and
beyond him Jenny Barrow and then Elspeth and
Gilian. Out of kirk, in the kirkyard, he gave them
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>good day. He studied to keep strangeness out of
his manner; an onlooker would note only a somewhat
silent, preoccupied laird. He might be pondering
the sermon. Mr. M'Nab's sermons were
calculated to arouse alarm and concern&mdash;or, in the
case of the justified, stern triumph&mdash;in the human
breast. White Farm made no quarrel with the
laird for that quietude and withdrawing. In the
autumn he had told Jarvis Barrow of that hour
with Elspeth in the stubble-field. The old man
listened, then, "They are strange warks, women!"
he said, and almost immediately went on to speak
of other things. There seemed no sympathy and
no regret for the earthly happening. But he liked
to debate with the laird election and the perseverance
of the saints.</p>

<p>Jenny Barrow, only, could not be held from exclamation
over Glenfernie's defection. "Why does
he na come as he used to? Wha's done aught to
him or said a word to gie offense?" She talked to
Menie and Merran since Elspeth and Gilian gave
her notice that they were wearied of the subject.
Perhaps Jenny's concern with it kept her from the
perception that not Glenfernie only was changing
or had changed. Elspeth&mdash;! But Elspeth had been
always a dreamer, rather silent, a listener rather
than a speaker. Jenny did not look around corners;
the overt sufficed for a bustling, good-natured life.
Gilian's arrival, moreover, made for a diversion of
attention. By the time novelty subsided again into
every day an altered Elspeth had so fitted into the
frame of life that Jenny was unaware of alteration.</p>

<p>But Gilian was not Jenny.</p>

<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>Each of Jarvis Barrow's granddaughters had her
own small bedroom. Three nights after Gilian's
home-coming she came, when the candles were out,
into Elspeth's room. It was September and, for
the season, warm. A great round moon poured its
light into the little room. Elspeth was seated upon
her bed. Her hair was loosened and fell over her
white gown. Her feet were under her; she sat like
an Eastern carving, still in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Elspeth!"</p>

<p>Elspeth took a moment to come back to White
Farm. "What is it, Gilian?"</p>

<p>Gilian moved to the window and sat in it. She
had not undressed. The moon silvered her, too.
"What has happened, Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"Naught. What should happen?"</p>

<p>"It's no use telling me that.&mdash;We've been away
from each other almost a year. I know that I've
changed, grown, in that time, and it's natural that
you should do the same. But it's something besides
that!"</p>

<p>Elspeth laughed and her laughter was like a little,
cold, mirthless chime of silver bells. "You're fanciful,
Gilian!... We're no longer lassies; we're women!
So the colors of things get a little different&mdash;that's
all!"</p>

<p>"Don't you love me, Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you. What has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Has it not? Has love naught to do with it?
Love at all&mdash;all love?"</p>

<p>Elspeth parted her long dark hair into two waves,
drew it before her, and began to braid it, sitting still,
her limbs under her, upon the bed. "I saw you on
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>the moor walking and talking with grandfather.
What did he say to you?"</p>

<p>"You are changed and I said that you were
changed. He had not noticed&mdash;he would not be
like to notice! Then he told me about the laird
and you."</p>

<p>"Yes. About the laird and me."</p>

<p>"You couldn't love him? They say he is a fine
man."</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't love him. I like him. He
understands. No one is to blame."</p>

<p>"But if it is not that, what is it&mdash;what is it,
Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"It's naught&mdash;naught&mdash;naught, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"It's a strange naught that makes you like a dark
lady in a ballad-book!"</p>

<p>Elspeth laughed again. "Didn't I say that you
were fanciful? It's late and I am sleepy."</p>

<p>That had been while the leaves were still upon
the trees. The next morning and thenceforward
Elspeth seemed to make a point of cheerfulness. It
passed with her aunt and the helpers in the house.
Jarvis Barrow appeared to take no especial note if
women laughed or sighed, so long as they lived
irreproachably.</p>

<p>The leaves bronzed, the autumn rains came, the
leaves fell, the trees stood bare, the winds began
to blow, there fell the first snowflakes. Gilian,
walking home from the town, was overtaken on
the moor by Robin Greenlaw.</p>

<p>"Where is Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"We are making our winter dresses. She would
not leave her sewing."</p>

<p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>The cousins walked upon the moor path together.
Gilian was fairer and more strongly made than Elspeth.
They walked in silence; then said Robin:</p>

<p>"You're the old Gilian, but I'm sure I miss the
old Elspeth!"</p>

<p>"I think, myself, she's gone visiting! I rack and
rack my brains to find what grief could have come
to Elspeth. She will not help me."</p>

<p>"Gilian, could it be that, after all, her heart is
set on the laird?"</p>

<p>"Did you know about that?"</p>

<p>"In part I guessed, watching them together.
And then I saw how Glenfernie oldened in a night.
Then, being with my uncle one day, he let drop
a word that I followed up. I led him on and he
told me. Glenfernie acted like a true man."</p>

<p>"If there's one thing of which I'm sure it is that
she hardly thinks of him from Sunday to Sunday.
She thinks then for a little because she sees him in
kirk&mdash;but that passes, too!"</p>

<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't know of anybody else.
Maybe no outer thing has anything to do with it.
Sometimes we just have drumlie, dreary seasons
and we do not know why.... She loves the spring.
Maybe when spring comes she'll be Elspeth once
more!"</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Greenlaw. "Spring makes all
the world bonny again."</p>

<p>That was in November. On Christmas Eve Elspeth
Barrow drowned herself in the Kelpie's Pool.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>There had been three hours of light on Christmas
Day when Robin Greenlaw appeared at
Glenfernie House and would see the laird.</p>

<p>"He's in his ain room in the keep," said Davie,
and went with the message.</p>

<p>Alexander came down the stair and out into the
flagged court. The weather had been unwontedly
clement, melting the earlier snows, letting the brown
earth forth again for one look about her. To-day
there was pale sunlight. Greenlaw sat his big gray.
The laird came to him.</p>

<p>"Get down, man, and come in for Christmas
cheer!"</p>

<p>"Send Davie away," said Greenlaw.</p>

<p>Alexander's gray eyes glanced. "You're bringing
something that is not Christmas cheer!&mdash;Davie, tell
Dandie Saunderson to saddle Black Alan at once.&mdash;Now,
Robin!"</p>

<p>"Yesterday," said Greenlaw, "Elspeth Barrow
vanished from White Farm. They wanted to send
Christmas fare to old Skene the cotter. She said
she would take a basket there, and so she went away,
down the stream&mdash;about ten of the morning they
think it was. It was not for hours that they grew
at all anxious. She's never come back. She did
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>not go to Skene's. We can hear no word of her from
any. Her grandfather and I and the men at White
Farm looked for her through the night. This morning
there's an alarm sent up and down the dale."</p>

<p>"What harm could happen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She might have strayed into some lonely place&mdash;fallen&mdash;hurt
herself. There were gipsies seen the
other day over by Windyedge. Or she might have
walked on and on upon what road she took, and
somehow none chanced to notice her. I am going
now to ride the Edinburgh way."</p>

<p>"Have you gone up the glen?"</p>

<p>"That was tried this morning at first light. But
that is just opposite to Skene's and the way she certainly
took at first. She would have to turn and
go about through the woods, or White Farm would
see her." His voice had a haunting note of fear
and trouble.</p>

<p>Glenfernie caught it. "She was not out of health
nor unhappy?"</p>

<p>"She is changed from the old Elspeth. When you
ask her if she is unhappy she says that she is not....
I do not know. Something is wrong. With the
others, I am seeking about as though I expected
each moment to see her sitting or standing by the
roadside. But I do not expect to see her. I do
not know what I expect. We have sent to Windyedge
to apprehend those gipsies."</p>

<p>"Let me speak one moment to Mr. Strickland to
send the men forth and go himself. Then I am
ready."</p>

<p>On Black Alan he rode with Robin down the hill
and through the wood and upon the White Farm
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>way. The earth was mainly bare of snow, but
frozen hard. The hoofs rang out but left no print.
The air hung still, light and dry; the sun, far in the
south, sent slanting, pale-gold beams. The two
men made little speech as they rode. They passed
men and youths, single figures and clusters.</p>

<p>"Ony news, Littlefarm? We've been&mdash;or we're
going&mdash;seeking here, or here&mdash;"</p>

<p>A woman stopped them. "It was thae gipsies,
sirs! I had a dream about them, five nights syne!
A lintwhite was flying by them, and they gave chase.
Either it's that or she made away with herself! I
had a dream that might be read that way, too."</p>

<p>When they came to White Farm it was to find
there only Jenny and Menie and Merran.</p>

<p>"Somebody maun stay to keep the house warm
gin the lassie come stumbling hame, cauld and
hungry and half doited! Eh, Glenfernie, ye that
are a learned man and know the warld, gie us help!"</p>

<p>"I am going up the glen," said Alexander to
Greenlaw. "I do not know why, but I think it
should be tried again. And I know it, root and
branch. I am going afoot. I will leave Black Alan
here."</p>

<p>They wasted no time. He went, while Robin
Greenlaw on his gray took the opposed direction.
Looking back, he saw the great fire that Jenny
kept, dancing through the open door and in the
pane of the window. Then the trees and the winding
of the path shut it away, shut away house and
field and all token of human life.</p>

<p>He moved swiftly to the mouth of the glen, but
then more slowly. The trees soared bare, the water
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>rushed with a hoarse sound, snow lay in clefts.
So well he knew the place! There was no spot where
foot might have climbed, no ledge nor opening where
form might lay, huddled or outstretched, that lacked
his searching eye or hand. Here was the pebbly
cape with the thorn-tree where in May he had come
upon Elspeth, sitting by the water, singing....
Farther on he turned into that smaller, that fairy
glen, bending like an arm from the main pass.
Here was the oak beneath which they had sat,
against which she had leaned. It wrapt him from
himself, this place. He stood, and space around
seemed filled with forms just beyond visibility.
What were they? He did not know, but they seemed
to breathe against his heart, to whisper.... He
searched this place well, but there were only the
winter banks and trees, the little burn, the invisible
presences. Back in the deep glen a hawk sailed
overhead, across the stripe of pale-blue sky. Alexander
went on by the stream and the projecting
rock and the twisted roots. There was no sound
other than the loud voice of the water, talking only
of its return to the sea. When he came to the cave
he pushed aside the masking growth and entered.
Dark and barren here, with the ashes of an old fire!
For one moment, as it were distinctly, he saw Ian.
He stood so clear in the mind's eye that it seemed
that one intense effort might have set him bodily
in the cavern. But the central strength let the
image go. Alexander moved the ashes of the fire
with his foot, shuddered in the place of cold and
shadow, and, stooping, went out of the cave and on
upon his search for Elspeth Barrow.</p>

<p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>He sought the glen through, and at last, at the
head, he came to Mother Binning's cot. Her fire
was burning; she was standing in the door looking
toward him.</p>

<p>"Eh, Glenfernie! is there news of the lassie?"</p>

<p>"None. You've got the sight. Can you not
<i>see</i>?"</p>

<p>"It's gane from me! When it gaes I'm just like
ony bird with a broken wing."</p>

<p>"If you cannot see, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I dinna want to think and I dinna want to say.
Whaur be ye gaeing now?"</p>

<p>"On over the moor and down by the Kelpie's
Pool."</p>

<p>"Gae on then. I'll watch for ye coming back."</p>

<p>He went on. Something strange had him, drawing
him. He came out from the band of trees upon
the swelling open moor, bare and brown save where
the snow laced it. Gold filtered over it; a pale sky
arched above; it was wide, still, and awful&mdash;a
desert. He saw the light run down and glint upon
the pool. Searchers had ridden across this moor
also, he had been told. He went down at once to
the pool and stood by the kelpie willow. He was
not thinking, he was not keenly feeling. He seemed
to stand in open, endless, formless space, and in
unfenced time. A clump of dry reeds rose by his
knee, and upon the other side of these he noticed
that a stone had been lifted from its bed. He
stooped, and in the reeds he found an inch-long
fragment of ribbon&mdash;of a snood.</p>

<p>He stepped back from the willow. He took off
and dropped upon the moor hat and riding-coat
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>and boots, inner coat and waistcoat. Then he entered
the Kelpie's Pool. He searched it, measure by
measure, and at last he found the body of Elspeth.
He drew it up; he loosened and let fall the stone
tied in the plaid that was wrapped around it; he
bore the form out of the pool and laid it upon the
bank beyond the willow. The sunlight showed the
whole, the face and figure. The laird of Glenfernie,
kneeling beside it, put back the long drowned
hair and saw, pinned upon the bosom of the gown,
the folded letter, wrapped twice in thicker paper.
He took it from her and opened it. The writing
was yet legible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hope that I shall not be found. If I am, let this answer
for me. I was unhappy, more unhappy than you can think.
Let no one be blamed. It was one far from here and you will
not know his name. Do not think of me as wicked nor as a
murderess. The unhappy should have pardon and rest. Good-by
to all&mdash;good-by!</p></div>

<p>In the upper corner was written, "For White
Farm." That was all.</p>

<p>Glenfernie put this letter into the bosom of his
shirt. He then got on again the clothing he had
discarded, and, stooping, put his arms beneath the
lifeless form. He lifted it and bore it from the
Kelpie's Pool and up the moor. He was a man
much stronger than the ordinary; he carried it as
though he felt no weight. The icy water of the
pool upon him was as nothing, and as he walked
his face was still as a stone face in a desert. So
he came with Elspeth's body back to the glen, and
Mother Binning saw him coming.</p>

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>"Hech, sirs! Hech, sirs! Will it hae been that
way&mdash;will it hae been that way?"</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment. He laid his burden
down upon the boards just within the door and
smoothed back the streaming hair. "Even the
shell flung out by the ocean is beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Eh, man! Eh, man! It's wae sometimes to
be a woman!"</p>

<p>"Give me," he said, "a plaid, dry and warm,
to hap her in."</p>

<p>"Will ye na leave her here? Put her in my bed
and gae tell White Farm!"</p>

<p>"No, I will carry her home."</p>

<p>Mother Binning took from a chest a gray plaid.
He lifted again the dead woman, and she happed the
plaid about her. "Ah, the lassie&mdash;the lassie! Come
to me, Glenfernie, and I will scry for you who it
was!"</p>

<p>He looked at her as though he did not hear her.
He lifted the body, holding it against his shoulder
like a child, and went forth. He knew the path so
absolutely, he was so strong and light of foot, that
he went without difficulty through the glen, by the
loud crying water, by the points of crag and the curving
roots and the drifts of snow, by the green
patches of moss and the trees great and small. He
did not hasten nor drag, he did not think. He went
like a bronze Talus, made simply to find, to carry
home.</p>

<p>Known feature after known feature of the place
rose before him, passed him, fell away. Here was
the arm of the glen, and here was the pebbled cape
and the thorn-tree. The winter water swirled
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>around it, sang of cold and a hateful power. Here
was the mouth of the glen. Here were the fields
which had been green and then golden with ripe corn.
Here were the White Farm roof and chimneys and
windows, and blue smoke from the chimney going
straight up like a wraith to meet blue sky. Before
him was the open door.</p>

<p>He had thought of there being only Jenny and the
two servant lasses. But in the time he had been
gone there had regathered to White Farm, for learning
each from each, for consultation, for mere rest
and food, a number of the searchers. Jarvis Barrow
had returned from the northward-stretching moor,
Thomas and Willy from the southerly fields. Men
who had begun to drag deep places in the stream
were here for some provision. A handful of women,
hooded and wrapped, had come from neighboring
farms or from the village. Among them talked Mrs.
Macmurdo, who kept the shop, and the hostess of
the Jardine Arms. And there was here Jock Binning,
who, for all his lameness and his crutches,
could go where he wished.... But it was Gilian,
crossing upon the stepping-stones, who saw Glenfernie
coming by the stream with the covered form
in his arms. She met him; they went up the
bank to the house together. She had uttered one
cry, but no more.</p>

<p>"The Kelpie's Pool," he had answered.</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow came out of the door. "Eh! God
help us!"</p>

<p>They laid the form upon a bed. All the houseful
crowded about. There was no helping that, and
as little might be helped Jenny's lamentations and
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>the ejaculations of others. It was White Farm himself
who took away the plaid. It lay there before
them all, the drowned form. The face was very
quiet, strangely like Elspeth again, the Elspeth of the
springtime. All looked, all saw.</p>

<p>"Gude guide us!" cried Mrs. Macmurdo. "And
I wadna be some at the Judgment Day when come
up the beguiled, self-drownit lassies!"</p>

<p>Jock Binning's voice rose from out the craning
group. "Aye, and I ken&mdash;and I ken wha was the
man!"</p>

<p>White Farm turned upon him. He towered, the
old man. A winter wrath and grief, an icy, scintillant,
arctic passion, marked two there, the laird of
Glenfernie and the elder of the kirk. Gilian's grief
stood head-high with theirs, but their anger, the old
man's disdaining and the young man's jealousy, was
far from her. In Jarvis Barrow's hand was the
paper, taken from Elspeth, given him by Glenfernie.
He turned upon the cripple. "Wha, then? Wha,
then? Speak out!"</p>

<p>He had that power of command that forced an
answer. Jock Binning, crutched and with an elfish
face and figure and voice, had pulled down upon
himself the office of revelator. The group swayed
a little from him and he was left facing White Farm
and the laird of Glenfernie. He had a wailing,
chanting, elvish manner of speech. Out streamed
this voice:</p>

<p>"'Twere the last of June, twa-three days after
the laird rode to Edinburgh, and she brought my
mither a giftie of plums and sat doon for a crack
with her. By he came and stood and talked.
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>Syne the clouds thickened and the thunder growlit,
and he wad walk with her hame through the glen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wha wad? Wha?"</p>

<p>"Captain Ian Rullock."</p>

<p>"<i>Ian Rullock!</i>"</p>

<p>"Aye, Glenfernie! And after that they never
came to my mither's again. But I marked them
aft when they didna mark me, in the glen. Aye, and
I marked them ance in the little glen, and there they
were lovers surely&mdash;gin kisses and clasped arms mak
lovers! She wad come by herself to their trysting,
and he wad come over the muir and down the crag-side.
It was na my business and I never thocht
to tell. But eh! all ill will out, says my mither!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>The early sunlight fell soft and fine upon the
river Seine and the quays and buildings of
Paris. The movement and buzz of people had, in
the brightness, something of the small ecstasy of
bees emerging from the hive with the winter pall just
slipped. Distant bells were ringing, hope enticed
the grimmest poverty. Much, after all, might be
taken good-naturedly!</p>

<p>A great, ornate coach, belonging to a person of
quality, crossed the Seine from the south to the
north bank. Three gentlemen, seated within, observed
each in his own fashion the soft, shining
day. One was Scots, one was English, and the owner
of the coach, a Frenchman. The first was Ian Rullock.</p>

<p>"Good weather for your crossing, monsieur!" remarked
the person of quality. He was so markedly
of position that the two men whom he had graciously
offered to bring a mile upon their way, and who also
were younger men, answered with deference and followed
in their speech only the lines indicated.</p>

<p>"It promises fair, sir," said Ian. "In three days
Dunkirk, then smooth seas! Good omens everywhere!"</p>

<p>"You do not voyage under your own name?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>"After to-morrow, sir, I am Robert Bonshaw, a
Scots physician."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, good fortune to you, and to the exalted
person you serve!"</p>

<p>The coach, cumbrous and stately, drawn by four
white horses, left the bridge and came under old
palace walls, and thence by narrow streets advanced
toward the great house of its owner. Outside was
the numerous throng, the scattering to this side and
that of the imperiled foot travelers. The coach
stopped.</p>

<p>"Here is the street you would reach!" said the
helpful person of quality.</p>

<p>A footman held open the door; the Scot and the
Englishman gave proper expression of gratitude to
their benefactor, descended to earth, turned again
to bow low, and waited bareheaded till the great
machine was once more in motion and monseigneur's
wig, countenance, and velvet coat grew things of
the past. Then the two turned into a still and
narrow street overhung by high, ancient structures
and roofed with April sky.</p>

<p>The one was going from Paris, the other staying.
Both were links in a long chain of political conspiring.
They walked now down the street that was
dark and old, underfoot old mire and mica-like glistening
of fresher rain. The Englishman spoke:</p>

<p>"Have you any news from home?"</p>

<p>"None. None for a long while. I had it conveyed
to my kindred and to an old friend that I
had disappeared from Paris&mdash;gone eastward, Heaven
knew where&mdash;probably Crim Tartary! So my own
world at least, as far as I am concerned, will be off
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>the scent. That was in the winter. I have really
heard nothing for months.... When the dawn
comes up and we are all rich and famed and gay, <i>my-lorded</i>
from John o' Groat's House to Land's End&mdash;then,
Warburton, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll be good!" Ian laughed. "Don't you
want, sometimes, to be good, Warburton? Wise&mdash;and
simple. Doesn't it rise before you in the night
with a most unearthly beauty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I am so-so good!" answered the
other. "So-so bad, so-so good. What puts you
in this strain?"</p>

<p>"Tell me and I will tell you! And now I'm going
to Scotland, into the Highlands, to paint a prince
who, when he's king, will, no manner of doubt,
wear the tartan and make every thane of Glamis
thane of Cawdor likewise!... One half the creature's
body is an old, childish loyalty, and the other half's
ambition. The creature's myself. There are also
bars and circles and splashes of various colors, dark
and bright. Sometimes it dreams of wings&mdash;wings
of an archangel, no less, Warburton! The next
moment there seems to be an impotency to produce
even beetle wings!... What a weathercock and
variorum I am, thou art, he is!"</p>

<p>"We're no worse than other men," said Warburton,
comfortably. "We're all pretty ignorant, I
take it!"</p>

<p>They came to a building, old and not without some
lingering of strength and grace. It stood in the
angle of two streets and received sunshine and light
as well as cross-tides of sound. The Scot and the
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>Englishman both lodged here, above a harness-maker
and a worker in fine woods. They passed
into the court and to a stair that once had known
a constant, worldly-rich traffic up and down. Now
it was still and twilight, after the streets. Both
men had affairs to put in order, business on hand.
They moved now abstractedly, and when Warburton
reached, upon the first landing, the door of his
rooms, he turned aside from Ian with only a negligent,
"We'll sup together and say last things then."</p>

<p>The Scot went on alone to the next landing and
his own room. These were not his usual lodgings in
Paris. Agent now of high Jacobite interests, shuttle
sent from conspirers in France to chiefs in Scotland,
on the eve of a departure in disguise, he had broken
old nest and old relations, and was now as a stranger
in a city that he knew well, and where by not a few
he was known. The room that he turned into had
little sign of old, well-liked occupancy; the servant
who at his call entered from a smaller chamber was
not the man to whom he was used, but a Highlander
sent him by a Gordon then in Paris.</p>

<p>"I am back, Donal!" said Ian, and threw himself
into a chair by the table. "Come, give an account
of your errands!"</p>

<p>Donal, middle-aged, faithful, dour and sagacious,
and years away from loch and mountain, gave account.
Horses, weapons, clothing, all correct for
Dr. Robert Bonshaw and his servant, riding under
high protection from Paris to Dunkirk, where a well-captained
merchant-vessel stayed for them in port.
Ian nodded approval.</p>

<p>"I'm indebted, Donal, to my cousin Gordon!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>Donal let a smile come to within a league of the
surface. "Her ainself has a wish to hear the eagle
scream over Ben Nevis!"</p>

<p>Rullock's hand moved over a paper, checking a
row of figures. "Did you manage to get into my
old lodging?"</p>

<p>"Aye. None there. All dusty and bare. But
the woman who had the key gave me&mdash;since I said
I might make a guess where to find you, sir&mdash;these
letters. They came, she said, two weeks ago."
Donal laid them upon the table.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Ian, "they must have gotten through
before I shut off the old passageway." He took
them in his hand. "There's nothing more now,
Donal. Go out for your dinner."</p>

<p>The man went. Ian added another column of
figures, then took the letters and with them moved
to a window through which streamed the sun of
France. The floor was patched with gold; there
was warmth as well as light. He pushed a chair
into it, sat down, and opened first the packet that
he knew had come from his uncle. He broke the
seal and read two pages of Mr. Touris in a mood of
anger. There were rumors&mdash;. True it was that
Ian had now his own fortune, had it at least
until he lost it and his life together in some mad,
unlawful business! But let him not look longer to
be heir of Archibald Touris! Withdraw at once
from ill company, political or other, and return to
Scotland, or at least to England, or take the consequences!
The letter bore date the first week of
December. It had been long in passing from hand
to hand in a troubled, warring world. Ian Rullock,
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>fathoms deep in the present business, held in a
web made by many lines of force, both thick and
thin, refolded the paper and made to put it into
his pocketbook, then bethinking himself, tore it instead
into small pieces and, rising, dropped these into
a brazier where burned a little charcoal. He would
carry nothing with his proper name upon it. Coming
back to the chair in the sunshine, he sat for a moment
with his eyes upon a gray huddle of roofs
visible through the window. Then he broke the
seal and unfolded the letter superscribed in Alexander's
strong writing.</p>

<p>There were hardly six lines. And they did not
tell of how discovery had been made, nor why, nor
when. They said nothing of death nor life&mdash;no
word of the Kelpie's Pool. They carried, tersely,
a direct challenge, the ground Ian Rullock's conception
of friendship, a conception tallying nicely
with Alexander Jardine's idea of a mortal enmity.
Such a fishing-town, known of both, back of such
a sea beach in Holland&mdash;such a tavern in this
place. Meet there&mdash;wait there, the one who should
reach it first for the other, and&mdash;to give all
possible ground to delays of letters, travel, arrangements
generally&mdash;in so late a month as April.
"Find me there, or await me there, my one-time
friend, henceforth my foe! I&mdash;or Justice
herself above me&mdash;would teach you certain
things!"</p>

<p>The cartel bore date the 1st of January&mdash;later
by a month than the Black Hill letter. It dropped
from Ian's hand; he sat with blankness of mind in
the sunlight. Presently he shivered slightly. He
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>leaned his elbows on his knees and his forehead in
his hands and sat still. Alexander! He felt no
hot straining toward meeting, toward fighting,
Alexander. Perversely enough, after a year of impatient,
contemptuous thought in that direction,
he had lately felt liking and an ancient strong
respect returning like a tide that was due. And
he could not meet Alexander in April&mdash;that was
impossible! No private affair could be attended to
now.</p>

<p>... Elspeth, of whom the letter carried no word,
Elspeth from whom he had not heard since in August
he left that countryside, Elspeth who had agreed
with him that love of man and woman was nobody's
business but their own, Elspeth who, when he would
go, had let him go with a fine pale refusal to deal in
women's tears and talk of injury, who had said, indeed,
that she did not repent, much bliss being worth
some bale&mdash;Elspeth whom he could not be sure
that he would see again, but whom at times before
his eyes at night he saw.... Immediately upon his
leaving Black Hill she had broken with Glenfernie.
She was clear of him&mdash;the laird could reproach her
with nothing!</p>

<p>What had happened? He had told her how, at
need, a letter might be sent. But one had never
come. He himself had never written. Writing was
set in a prickly ring of difficulties and dangers.
What had happened? Strong, secret inclination
toward finding least painful things for himself
brought his conclusion. Sitting there in the sunshine,
his will deceiving him, he determined that it
was simply that Elspeth had at last told Glenfernie
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>that she could not love him because she loved
another. Probably&mdash;persistence being markedly a
trait of Old Steadfast's&mdash;he had been after her once
and again, and she had turned upon him and said
much more than in prudence she should have said!
So Alexander would have made his discovery and
might, if he pleased, image other trysts than his own
in the glen! Certainly he had done this, and then
sat down and penned his challenge!</p>

<p>Elspeth! He was unshakably conscious that
Glenfernie would tell none what Elspeth might
have been provoked into giving away. Old Steadfast,
there was no denying, had that knightliness.
Three now knew&mdash;no more than three. If,
through some mischance, there had been wider
discovery, she would have written! The Black
Hill letter, too, would have had somewhat there
to say.</p>

<p>Then, behind the challenge, stood old and new relations
between Ian Rullock and Alexander Jardine!
It was what Glenfernie might choose to term the
betrayal of friendship&mdash;a deep scarification of Old
Steadfast's pride, a severing cut given to his too
imperial confidence, poison dropped into the wells
of domination, "No!" said to too much happiness,
to any surpassing of him, Ian, in happiness, "No!"
to so much reigning!</p>

<p>Ian shook himself, thrust away the doubtful
glimmer of a smile. That way really did lie
hell....</p>

<p>He came back to a larger if a much perplexed
self. He could not meet Glenfernie on that sea
beach, fight him there. He did not desire to kill
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>Old Steadfast, though, as the world went, pleasure
was to be had in now and then giving superiority
pain. Face to face upon those sands, some blood
shed and honor satisfied, Alexander would be reasonable&mdash;being
by nature reasonable! Ian shook himself.</p>

<p>"Now he draws me like a lodestone, and now I
feel Lucifer to his Michael! What old, past mountain
of friendship and enmity has come around,
full wheel?"</p>

<p>But it was impossible for him to go to that sea
strand in Holland.</p>

<p>Elspeth! He wondered what she was doing this
April day. Perhaps she walked in the glen. It was
colder there than here, but yet the trees would be
budding. He saw her face again, and all its ability
to show subtle terror and subtle joy, and the glancing
and the running of the stream between. Elspeth....
He loved her again as he sat there, somewhat
bowed together in the sunlight, Alexander's challenge
upon the floor by his foot. There came creeping to
him an odd feeling of long ago having loved her&mdash;long
ago and more than once, many times more than
once. Name and place alone flickered. There
might be something in Old Steadfast's contention
that one lived of old time and all time, only there
came breaking in dozing and absent-mindedness!
Elspeth&mdash;</p>

<p>He saw her standing by him, and it seemed as
though she had a basket on her arm, and she looked
as she had looked that day of the thunder-storm
and the hour in the cave behind the veil of rain.
Without warning there welled into his mind broken
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>lines from an old tale in verse of which he was
fond:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Me dreamed al this night, pardie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An elf-queen shall my leman be ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An elf-queen wil I have, I-wis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in this world no woman is<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Worthy to be my mate ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Al other women I forsake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to an elf-queen I me take<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By dale and eke by down."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Syllable and tone died. With his hand he brushed
from his eyes the vision that he knew to be nothing
but a heightened memory. Might, indeed, all
women be one woman, one woman be all women,
all forms one form, all times one time, like event
fall softly, imperceptibly, upon like event until there
was thickness, until there was made a form of all
recurrent, contributory forms? Events, tendencies,
lives&mdash;unimaginable continuities! Repetitions and
repetitions and repetitions&mdash;and no one able to
leave the trodden road that ever returned upon itself&mdash;no
one able to take one step from the circle
into a new dimension and thence see the form
below....</p>

<p>Ian put his hands over his eyes, shook himself,
started up and stood at the window. Sky, and roofs
on roofs, and in the street below toy figures, pedestrians.
"Come back&mdash;come back to breathable air!
Now what's to be done&mdash;what's to be done?" After
some moments he turned and picked up the letter
upon the floor and read it twice. In memory and
in imagination he could see the fishing-town, the
inn there, the dunes, the ocean beach fretted by the
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>long, incoming wave. Perhaps and most probably,
this very bright afternoon, the laird of Glenfernie
waited for him there, pacing the sands, perhaps,
watching the comers to the inn door.... Well, he
must watch in vain. Ian Rullock would one day
give him satisfaction, but certainly not now. Vast
affairs might not be daffed aside for the laird of
Glenfernie's convenience! Ian stood staring out of
window at those huddled roofs, the challenge still
in his hand. Then, slowly, he tore the paper to
pieces and committed it to the brazier where was
already consumed Black Hill's communication.</p>

<p>That evening he supped with Warburton, and the
next morning saw him and Donal riding forth from
Paris, by St.-Denis, on toward Dunkirk. From this
place, four days later, sailed the brig <i>Cock of the
North</i>, destination the Beauly Firth. Dr. Robert
Bonshaw and his man experienced, despite the prediction
of the Frenchman of quality, a rough and
long voyage. But the <i>Cock of the North</i> weathered
tumultuous sea and wind and came, in the northern
spring, to anchor in a great picture of firth and
green shore and dark, piled mountains. Dr. Robert
Bonshaw and his man, going ashore and into Inverness,
found hospitality there in the house of a certain
merchant. Thence, after a day or so, he traveled
to the castle of a Highland chief of commanding
port. Here occurred a gathering; here letters and
asseverations brought from France were read, listened
to, weighed or taken without much weighing, so did
the Highland desire run one way. An old net added
to itself another mesh.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Bonshaw, a very fit, invigorating
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>agent, traveled far and near through the Highlands
this May, this June, this July. It was to him an
interesting, difficult, intensely occupied time; he
was far from Lowland Scotland and any echoes
therefrom, saving always political echoes. He had
no leisure for his own affairs, saving always that
background consideration that, if the Stewarts really
got back the crown, Ian Rullock was on the road
to power and wealth. This consideration was not
articulate, but diffused. It interfered not at all
with the foreground activities and hard planning&mdash;no
more than did the fine Highland air. It only
spurred him as did the winy air. The time and
place were electric; he worked hard, many hours
on end, and when he sought his bed he dropped at
once to needed sleep. From morn till late at
night, whether in castle or house or journeying
from clan to clan, he was always in company.
There was no time for old thoughts, memories, surmises.
That was one world and he was now in
another.</p>

<p>Upon the eleventh day of May, the year 1745, was
fought in Flanders the battle of Fontenoy. The
Duke of Cumberland, K&ouml;nigsegge the Austrian,
and the Dutch Prince of Waldeck had the handling
of something under fifty thousand English. Marshal
Saxe with Louis XV at his side wielded a somewhat
larger number of French. The English and
their allies were beaten. French spirits rode on high,
French intentions widened.</p>

<p>The Stewart interest felt the blood bound in its
veins. The bulk of the British army was on the
Continent and shaken by Fontenoy; King George
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>himself tarried in Hanover. Now was the time&mdash;now
was the time for the heir of all the Stewarts
to put his fortune to the touch&mdash;to sail from France,
to land in Scotland, to raise his banner and draw
his sword and gather Highland chief and Lowland
Jacobite, the while in England rose for him and his
father English Jacobites and soon, be sure, all English
Tories! France would send gold and artillery
and men to her ancient ally, Scotland. Up at last
with the white Stewart banner! reconquer for the
old line and all it meant to its adherents the two
kingdoms! In the last week of July Prince Charles
Edward, somewhat strangely and meagerly attended,
landed at Loch Sunart in the Highlands.
There he was joined by Camerons, Macdonalds, and
Stewarts, and thence he moved, with an ever-increasing
Highland <i>tail</i>, to Perth. A bold stream
joined him here&mdash;northern nobles of power, with
their men. He might now have an army of two
thousand. Sir John Cope, sent to oppose him with
what British troops there were in Scotland, allowed
himself to be circumvented. The Prince, having
proclaimed his father, still at Rome, James III,
King of Great Britain, and produced his own commission
as Regent, marched from Perth to Edinburgh.
The city capitulated and Charles Edward
was presently installed in Holyrood, titularly at
home in his father's kingdom, in his ancient
palace, among his loyal subjects, but actually with
far the major moiety of that kingdom yet to
gain.</p>

<p>The gracious act of rewarding must begin. Claim
on royal gratitude is ever a multitudinous thing! In
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>the general manifoldness, out of the by no means
yet huge store of honey Ian Rullock, for mere first
rung of his fortune's ladder, received the personally
given thanks of his Prince and a captaincy in the
none too rapidly growing army.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>The castle, defiant, untakable save by long siege
and famine, held for King George by a garrison
of a few hundreds, spread itself like a rock lion
in a high-lifted rock lair. Bands of Highlanders
watched its gates and accesses, guarding against
Hanoverian sallies. From the castle down stretched
Edinburgh, heaped upon its long, spinelike hill, to
the palace of Holyrood, and all its tall houses, tall
and dark, and all its wynds and closes, and all its
strident voices, and all its moving folk, seemed to
have in mind that palace and the banner before it.
The note of the having rang jubilation in all its
degrees, or with a lower and a muffled sound distaste
and fear, or it aimed at a middle strain neither high
nor low, a golden mean to be kept until there might
be seen what motif, after all, was going to prevail!
It would never do, thought some, to be at this juncture
too clamorous either way. But to the unpondering
ear the jubilation carried it, as to the eye
tartans and white cockades made color, made high
light, splashed and starred and redeemed the gray
town. There was one thing that could not but
appeal. A Scots royal line had come into its home
nest at Holyrood. Not for many and many and
many a year had such a thing as that happened!
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>If matters went in a certain way Edinburgh might
regain ancient pomp and circumstance. That was
a consideration that every hour arranged a new
plea in the citizen heart.</p>

<p>Excitement, restless movement, tendency to come
together in a crowd, were general, as were ejaculation,
nervous laughter, declamation. The roll of
drum, call of trumpet, skirl of pipes, did not lack.
Charles Edward's army encamped itself at Duddingston
a little to the east of the city. But its units
came in numbers into the town. The warlike hue
diffused itself. Horsemen were frequent, and a
continual entering of new adherents, men in small
or large clusters, marching in from the country,
asking the way to the Prince. For all the buzzing
and thronging, great order prevailed. Women sat
or stood at windows, or passed in and out of dark
wynds, or, escorted, picked their way at street
crossings. Now and then went by a sedan-chair.
Many women showed in their faces a truly religious
fervor, a passionate Jacobite loyalty, lighting like
a flame. Many sewed white cockades. All Scotland,
all England, would surely presently want
these! Men of all ranks, committed to the great
venture, moved with a determined gaiety and <i>&eacute;lan</i>.
"This is the stage, we are the actors; the piece is
a great piece, the world looks on!" The town of
Edinburgh did present a grandiose setting. Suspense,
the die yet covered, the greatness of the risk,
gave, too, its glamour of height and stateliness. All
these men might see, in some bad moment at night,
not only possible battle death&mdash;that was in the
counting&mdash;but, should the great enterprise fail,
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>scaffolds and hangmen. Many who went up and
down were merely thoughtless, ignorant, reckless, or
held in a vanity of good fortune, yet to the eye of
history all might come into the sweep of great
drama. Place and time rang and were tense. Flare
and sonorousness and a deep vibration of the old
massive passions, and through all the outward air
a September sea mist creeping.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock, walking down the High Street, approaching
St. Giles, heard his name spoken from a
little knot of well-dressed citizens. As he turned
his head a gentleman detached himself from the
company. It proved to be Mr. Wotherspoon the
advocate, old acquaintance and adviser of Archibald
Touris, of Black Hill.</p>

<p>"Captain Rullock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Wotherspoon, I am glad to see you!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wotherspoon, old moderate Whig, and the
Jacobite officer walked together down the clanging
way. The mist was making pallid garlands for the
tall houses, a trumpet rang at the foot of the street,
Macdonald of Glengarry and fifty clansmen, bright
tartan and screaming pipes, poured by.</p>

<p>"Auld Reekie sees again a stirring time!" said
the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I am glad to have met you, sir," said Rullock.
"I fancy that you can tell me home news. I have
heard none for a long time."</p>

<p>"You have been, doubtless," said Mr. Wotherspoon,
"too engaged with great, new-time things to
be fashed with small, old-time ones."</p>

<p>"One of our new-time aims," said Ian, "is to
give fresh room to an old-time thing. But we
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>won't let little bolts fly! I am anxious for knowledge."</p>

<p>Mr. Wotherspoon seemed to ponder it. "I live
just here. Perhaps you will come up to my rooms,
out of this Mars' racket?"</p>

<p>"In an hour's time I must wait on Lord George
Murray. But I have till then."</p>

<p>They entered a close, and climbed the stair of a
tall, tall house, dusky and old. Here, half-way up,
was the lawyer's lair. He unlocked a door and the
two came, through a small vestibule, into a good-sized,
comfortable, well-furnished room. Rullock
glanced at the walls.</p>

<p>"I was here once or twice, years ago. I remember
your books. What a number you have!"</p>

<p>"I recall," said Mr. Wotherspoon, "a visit that
you paid me with the now laird of Glenfernie."</p>

<p>The window to which they moved allowed a
glimpse of the colorful street. Mr. Wotherspoon
closed it against the invading noise and the touch
of chill in the misty air. He then pushed two
chairs to the table and took from a cupboard a
bottle and glasses.</p>

<p>"My man is gadding, with eyes like saucers&mdash;like
the rest of us, like the rest of us, Captain Rullock!"
They sat down. "My profession," said
the lawyer, "can be made to be narrow and narrowing.
On the other hand, if a man has an aptitude
for life, there is much about life to be learned with
a lawyer's spy-glass! A lawyer sees a variety of
happenings in a mixed world. He quite especially
learns how seldom black and white are found in
anything like a pure condition. A thousand thou<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>sand
blends. Be wise and tolerant&mdash;or to be wise
be tolerant!" He pushed the bottle.</p>

<p>Ian smiled. "I take that, sir, to mean that you
find <i>God save King James!</i> not wholly harsh and
unmusical&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not wholly so," said the lawyer. "I
am Whig and Presbyterian and I prefer <i>God save
King George!</i> But I do not look for the world to
end, whether for King George or King James. I
did not have in mind just this public occasion."</p>

<p>His tone was dry. Ian kept his gold-brown eyes
upon him. "Tell me what you have heard from
Black Hill."</p>

<p>"I was there late in May. Mr. Touris learned
at that time that you had quitted France."</p>

<p>"May I ask how he learned it?"</p>

<p>"The laird of Glenfernie, who had been in the
Low Countries, told him. Apparently Glenfernie
had acquaintances, agents, who traced it out for him
that you had sailed from Dunkirk for Beauly Firth,
under the name of Robert Bonshaw."</p>

<p>"<i>So he was there, pacing the beach</i>," thought Ian.
He lifted his glass and drank Mr. Wotherspoon's
very good wine. That gentleman went on.</p>

<p>"It was surmised at Black Hill that you were
helping on the event&mdash;the great event, perhaps&mdash;that
has occurred. Indeed, in July, Mr. Touris,
writing to me, mentioned that you had been seen
beyond Inverness. But the Highlands are deep and
you traveled rapidly. Of course, when it was known
that the Prince had landed, your acquaintance assumed
your joining him and becoming, as you have become,
an officer in his army." He made a little bow.</p>

<p><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>Ian inclined his head in return. "All at Black
Hill are well, I hope? My aunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Alison is a saint. All earthly grief, I
imagine, only quickens her homeward step."</p>

<p>"What grief has she had, sir, beyond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beyond?"</p>

<p>"I know that my aunt will grieve for the break
that has come between my uncle and myself. I
have, too," said Ian, with deliberation, "been quarreled
with by an old friend. That also may distress
her."</p>

<p>The lawyer appeared to listen to sounds from the
street. Rising, he moved to the window, then returned.
"Bonnet lairds coming into town! You
are referring now to Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>"Then he has made it common property that he
chose to quarrel with me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, chose to&mdash;" said Mr. Wotherspoon, reflectively.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Ian set down his wine-glass,
made a movement of drawing together, of
determination.</p>

<p>"I am sure that there is something of which I
have not full understanding. You will much oblige
me by attention to what I now say, Mr. Wotherspoon.
It is possible that I may ask you to see that
its substance reaches Black Hill." He leaned back
in his chair and with his gold-brown eyes met the
lawyer's keen blue ones. "Nothing now can be
injured by telling you that for a year I have acted
under responsibility of having in keeping greater
fortunes than my own. That kind of thing, none
can know better than you, binds a man out of his
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>own path and his own choices into the path and
choices of others. Secrecy was demanded of me.
I ceased to write home, and presently I removed
from old lodgings and purposely blurred indications
of where I was or might be found. In this way&mdash;the
warring, troubled time aiding&mdash;it occurred that
there practically ceased all communication between
me and those of my blood and friendship whose
political thinking differs from mine.... I begin to
see that I know little indeed of what may or may
not have occurred in that countryside. Early in
April, however, there came to my hand in Paris two
letters&mdash;one from my uncle, written before Christmas,
one from Alexander Jardine, written a month
later. My uncle's contained the information that,
lacking my immediate return to this island and the
political faith of his side of the house, I was no
longer his nephew and heir. The laird of Glenfernie,
upon an old quarrel into which I need not
enter, chose to send me a challenge simply. <i>Meet
him, on such a sands in Holland</i>.... Well, great
affairs have right of way over small ones! Under
the circumstances, he might as well have appointed
a plain in the moon! The duel waits.... I tell
you what I know of home affairs. I shall be obliged
for any information you may have that I have not."</p>

<p>Mr. Wotherspoon's sharp blue eyes seemed to
consider it. He drummed on the table. "I am a
much older man than you, Captain Rullock, and an
old adviser of your family. Perhaps I may speak
without offense? That subject of quarrel, now,
between you and the laird of Glenfernie&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other made a movement, impatient and im<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>perious.
"It is not likely, sir, that he divulged
that!"</p>

<p>"He? No! But fate&mdash;fortune&mdash;the unrolling
course of things&mdash;plain Providence&mdash;whatever you
choose to call it&mdash;seems at times quite below or
above that reticence which we others so naturally
prize and exhibit!"</p>

<p>"You'll oblige me, sir, by not speaking in riddles."</p>

<p>The irony dropped from Mr. Wotherspoon's tone.
He faced the business squarely. "Do you mean to
say that you do not know of the suicide of Elspeth
Barrow?"</p>

<p>The chair opposite made a grating sound, pushed
violently back upon the bare, polished floor. Down
the street, through the window, came the sound of
Cluny Macpherson's pipers, playing down from the
Lawnmarket. Rullock seemed to have thrust his
chair back into the shadow. Out of it came presently
his voice, low and hoarse:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They found her on Christmas Day&mdash;drowned in
the Kelpie's Pool. Self-murder&mdash;murder also of a
child that would have been."</p>

<p>Again silence. The lawyer found that he must
go through with it, having come so far. "It seems
that there is a cripple fellow of the neighborhood
who had stumbled, unseen, upon your trysts. He
told&mdash;spoke it all out to the crowd gathered. There
was a letter, too, upon her which gave a clue. But
she never named you and evidently meant not to
name you.... Poor child! She may have thought
herself strong, and then things have come over her
wave on wave. Her grandfather&mdash;that dark up<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>bringing
on tenets harsh and wrathful&mdash;certainty of
disgrace. Pitiful!"</p>

<p>There came a sound from the chair pushed back
from the light. Mr. Wotherspoon measured the
table with his fingers.</p>

<p>"It seems that the countryside was searching for
her. It was the laird of Glenfernie who, alone and
coming upon some trace, entered the Kelpie's Pool
and found her there. They say that he carried her,
dead, in his arms through the glen to White Farm."</p>

<p>Some proclamation or other was being made at
the Cross of Edinburgh. A trumpet blew and the
street was filled with footsteps.</p>

<p>"The laird of Glenfernie," said the lawyer, "has
joined, I hear, Sir John Cope at Dunbar. It is not
impossible that you may have speech together from
opposing battle-lines." He poured wine. "My
bag of news is empty, Captain Rullock."</p>

<p>Ian rose from his seat. His face was gray and
twisted, his voice, when he spoke, hollow, low, and
dry. "I must go now to Lord George Murray....
It was all news, Mr. Wotherspoon. I&mdash;What
are words, anyhow? Give you good day, sir!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wotherspoon, standing in his door, watched
him down the stair and forth from the house. "He
goes brawly! How much is night, and how much
streak of dawn?"</p>

<hr style='width: 33%;' />

<p>Sir John Cope, King George's general in Scotland,
had but a small army. It was necessary in the
highest degree that Prince Charles Edward should
meet and defeat this force before it was enlarged,
before from England came more and more regular
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>troops.... A battle won meant prestige gained, the
coming over of doubting thousands, an echo into
England that would bring the definite accession of
great Tory names. Cope and his twenty-five hundred
men, regulars and volunteers, approaching Edinburgh
from the east, took position near the village
of Prestonpans. On the morning of the 20th of
September out moved to meet him the Prince and
Lord George Murray, behind them less than two
thousand men.</p>

<p>By afternoon the two forces confronted each the
other; but Cope had chosen well, the right position.
The sea guarded one flank, a deep and wide field
ditch full of water the other. In his rear were stone
walls, and before him a wide marsh. The Jacobite
strength halted, reconnoitered, must perforce at
last come to a standstill before Cope's natural
fortress. There was little artillery, no great number
of horse. Even the bravest of the brave, Highland
or Lowland, might draw back from the thought
of trying to cross that marsh, of meeting the moat-like
ditch under Cope's musket-fire. Sunset came
amid perturbation, a sense of check, impending
disaster.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock, acting for the moment as aide-de-camp,
had spent the day on horseback. Released in
the late afternoon, lodged in a hut at the edge of
the small camp, he used the moment's leisure to
climb a small hill and at its height to throw himself
down beside a broken cairn. He shut his eyes,
but after a few moments opened them and gazed
upon the camp of Cope, covering also but a little
space, so small were the armies. His lips parted.</p>

<p><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>"Well, Old Steadfast, and what if you are there,
waiting?..."</p>

<p>The sun sank. A faint red light diffused itself,
then faded into brown dusk. He rose and went
down into the camp. In the brows of many there
might be read depression, uncertainty. But in open
places fires had been built, and about several of these
Highlanders were dancing to the screaming of their
pipes. Rullock bent his steps to headquarters. An
officer whom he knew, coming forth, drew him aside
in excitement.</p>

<p>"We've got it&mdash;we've got it, Rullock!"</p>

<p>"What? The plan?"</p>

<p>"The way through! Here has come to the Prince
the man who owns the marsh! He knows the firm
ground. Cope does not know that it is there!
Cope thinks that it is all slough! This man swears
that he can and will take us across, one treading
behind another. It's settled. When sleep seems to
wrap us, then we'll move!"</p>

<p>That was what was done, and done so perfectly, late
at night, Sir John Cope sleeping, thinking himself
safe as in a castle. File after file wound noiselessly,
by the one way through the marsh, and upon the
farther side, so near to Cope, formed in the darkness
into battle-lines.... Ian Rullock, passing
through the marsh, saw in imagination Alexander
lying with eyes closed.</p>

<p>The small force, the Stewart hope, prepared for
onslaught. The dawn was coming, there was a
smell of it in the air, far away a cock crowed.
There stood, in the universal dimness, a first and
strongest line, a second and weaker, badly armed
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>line. The mass of this army were Highlanders, alert,
strong, accustomed to dawn movements, dreamlike in
the heather, along the glen-sides, in the crooked
pass. They knew the tactics of surprise. They had
claymores and targes, and the most muskets. But
the second line had inadequate provision of weapons.
Many here bore scythes fastened to staves. As
they carried these over their shoulders Ian, looking
back, saw them against the palest light like Death
in replica.</p>

<p>The two lines hung motionless, on stout ground,
now within the defense to which Cope had trusted,
very close to the latter's sleeping camp. There were
sentries, but the night was dark, the marsh believed
to be unpassable, the crossing carried out with
stealthy skill. But now the night was going.</p>

<p>In the most uncertain, the faintest light, there
seemed to Cope's watchers, looking that way, a line
of bushes not noted the day before. Officers were
awakened. A movement ran through the camp like
the shiver of water under dawn wind. The light
thickened. A trumpet rang with a startled, emphatic
note. Drums rolled. <i>To arms! To arms!</i>
King George's army started up in the dawning.
Infantry hastened into ranks, cavalrymen ran to
their horses. The line of bushes moved, began to
come forward with great rapidity.</p>

<p>The Highlanders flung themselves upon Cope's
just-forming cavalry. With their claymores they
slashed at the faces of horses. The hurt beasts
wheeled, broke for the rear. Their fellows were
wounded. Amid a whirlwind of blows, screams,
shouts, with a suddenness that appalled, disorder
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>became general. The Highlanders seemed to fight
with a demoniac strength and ferocity and after
methods of their own. They used their claymores,
their dirks, their scythes fastened upon poles,
against the horses, then, springing up, put long arms
about the horsemen and, regardless of sword or
pistol, dragged them down. They shouted their
Gaelic slogans; their costume, themselves, seemed
out of a fiercer, earlier world. A strangeness overclouded
the senses; mist wreaths were everywhere,
and an uncertainty as to the numbers of demons....
The cavalry broke. Officers tried to save the situation,
to rally the units, to save all from being borne
back. But there was no helping. Befell a panic
flight, and at its heels the Highland rush streamed
into and had its way with Cope's infantry. The
battle was won with a swift and horrible completeness
and became a massacre. Not much quarter
was given; much that was horrible was done and
seen. Immoderate victory sat and sang to the white-cockaded
army.</p>

<p>Out of the mist-bank before Captain Ian Rullock
grew a great horse with a man upon it of great
stature and frame. It came to the Jacobite like a
vision, with a startling and intense reality. He was
standing with his sword drawn; there was a drift
of mist, and then there was the horse and rider&mdash;there
was Alexander.</p>

<p>He looked down at Ian, and his face was not pale
but set. He made a gesture that seemed full of
satisfaction, and would have dismounted and drawn
his sword. But there came a dash of maddened
horses and their riders and a leaping stream of tar<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>taned
men. These drove like a wedge between;
his horse wheeled, would leave no more its fellows;
the tide of brute and man bore him away with it.
Ian watched all go fighting by, a moving frieze, out
of the mist into the mist.</p>

<p>A triumphant Stewart went back to Holyrood,
an exultant army, calling itself, now with
some good show of bearing it through, the "royal"
army, carried into Edinburgh its confident step and
sanguine hue. Victory was with the old line, the
magnificent attempt! The erstwhile doubting throng
began, stage by stage, to mount toward enthusiasm.
It was the quicker done that Charles Edward, or
his wisest advisers, put forth a series of judicious
civic and public measures. And, now that Cope
had fled, King George had in Scotland no regular
troops. Every day there came open accessions to
the Prince's strength. The old Stewarts up again
became a magnet, drawing more and more the filings.
The Prince had presently between five and six
thousand troops. The north was his, Edinburgh,
the Jacobites scattered through the Lowlands. The
moderate Whig and Presbyterian might begin to think
of compounding, of finding virtues in necessity. The
irreconcilables felt great alarm and saw coming upon
them a helplessness.</p>

<p>But the Stewarts, with French approval behind,
aimed at the recovery of England no less than Scotland.
Windsor might well overdazzle Holyrood.
This interest had received many and strong pro<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>testations
of support from a wide swathe of
English nobility and gentry. Lift the victorious
army over the border, set it and the young Prince
bodily upon English ground, would not great family
after great family rouse its tenants, arm them, join
the Prince? So at least it seemed to the flushed
Stewart hope. King George was home from Hanover,
British troops being brought back from the
Continent. Best to fan high the fire of the rising
while it might with most ease be fanned&mdash;best to
march as soon as might be into England!</p>

<p>On the 1st of November they marched, three detachments
by three roads, and the meeting-place
Carlisle. All went most merrily well. On the 10th
of November began the siege of Carlisle. The
Prince had cannon now, some taken at Prestonpans,
some arrived, no great time before, from France,
first fruits of French support. The English General
Wade was at Newcastle with a larger army than
that of the Jacobites. But the siege of Carlisle was
not lifted by Wade. After three days city and castle
surrendered. Charles Edward and his army entered
England.</p>

<p>From Carlisle they marched to Penrith&mdash;to Kendal,
Lancaster, Preston, Manchester&mdash;clear, well-conducted
marches, the army held well together
and in hand, here and there handfuls of recruits.
But no flood of loyally-shouting gentry, no bearers
of great names drawing the sword for King James
III and a gallant, youthful Regent! Each dawn
said they will come! Each eve said they have not
come! One month from leaving Edinburgh found
this army of Highland chiefs and their clans, Lowland<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>
Scots, a few Englishmen, a few Irishmen, and
a few Frenchmen, led by skilful enough generals and
by a Prince the great-grandson of Charles I, deep in
England, but little advanced in bulk for all that.
Old cavalier England stayed upon its acres. Other
times, other manners! And how to know when an
old vortex begins to disintegrate and a mode of
action becomes antiquated, belated?</p>

<p>Wade was to one side with his army, and now there
loomed ahead the Duke of Cumberland and ten
thousand English troops. Battle seemed imminent,
yet again the Scots force pushed by. The 4th of
December found this strange wedge, of no great
mass, but of a tested, rapier-like keenness and hardness,
at the town of Derby, with London not a hundred
and thirty miles away. And still no English
rising for the rightful King! Instead Whig armies,
and a slow Whiggish buzzing beginning through all
the country.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland and Marshal Wade,
two jaws opening for Jacobite destruction, had between
them twenty thousand men. Spies brought
report of thirty thousand drawn up before London,
on Finchley Common. The Prince might have so
many lions of the desert in his Highlanders, but
multitude will make a net that lions cannot break.
At Derby also they had news from that Scotland
now so dangerously far behind them. Royal Scots
had landed from France, the Irish brigade from the
same country was on the seas, and French regiments
besides. Lord John Drummond had in Scotland
now at least three thousand men and good promise
of more. The Prince held council with the Duke of
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>Perth, Lord George Murray, Lord Nairn, the many
chiefs and leading voices. Return to Scotland, make
with these newly gathered troops and with others a
greater army, expect aid from France, stand in a
gained kingdom the onslaught from Hanoverian
England? Or go on&mdash;go on toward London? Encounter,
defeat, with half his number, the Duke
of Cumberland's ten thousand, keep Wade from
closing in behind them, meet the Finchley Common
thousands, come to the enemy's capital of half a
million souls? Return where there were friends?
Go on where false-promising friends hugged safety?
Go on to London, still hoping, trusting still to the
glamour and outcry that ran before them, to extraordinary
events called miracles? Hot was the
debate! But on the 6th of December the Jacobite
army turned back toward Scotland.</p>

<p>It began its homeward march long before dawn.
Not all nor most had been told the decision. Even
the changed direction, eyes upon slow-descending
not upon climbing stars, did not at first enlighten.
It might mean some d&eacute;tour, the Duke being out-maneuvered.
But at last rose the winter dawn and
lit remembered scene after scene. The news ran.
The army was in retreat.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock, riding with a kinsman, Gordon,
heard, up and down, an angry lamenting sound.
"Little do the clans like turning back!"</p>

<p>"Hark! The chieftains are telling them it is for
the best."</p>

<p>"Is it for the best? I do not like this month
or aught that is done in it!"</p>

<p>A week later they were at Lancaster; three days
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>after that at Kendal. Here Wade might have
fallen upon them, but did not. A day or two and
the main column approached Penrith. The no
great amount of artillery was yet precious. Heavy
to drag over heavy roads, the guns and straining
horses were left in the rear. Four companies of
Lowland infantry, Macdonald of Glengarry and his
five hundred Highlanders, a few cavalrymen, and
Lord George Murray himself tarried with the guns.
The main column disappeared, lost among mountains
and hills; this detached number had the wild
country, the forbidding road, the December day to
themselves. To get the guns and ammunition-wagons
along proved a snail-and-tortoise business.
Guns and escort fell farther and farther behind.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock, acting still as aide, rode from the
Prince nearing Penrith to Lord George Murray, now
miles to the rear. Why was the delay? and 'ware
the Duke of Cumberland, certainly close at hand!
The delay was greater, the distance between farther,
than the Prince had supposed. Rullock rode through
the late December afternoon by huge frozen waves
of earth, under a roof of pallid blue, in his ears a
small complaining wind like a wailing child. He
rode till nightfall, and only then came to his objective,
finding needed rest in the village of Shap.
Here he sought Lord George Murray, gave information
and was given it in turn, ate, drank, and
then turned back through the December night to
the Prince.</p>

<p>He rode and the huge winter stars seemed to
watch him with at once a glittering intentness and
a disdain of his pygmy being. Once he looked up to
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>them with a gesture of his head. "Are we so far
apart and so different?" he asked of Orion.</p>

<p>He was several miles upon his way to Penrith.
Before him appeared a crossroad, noted by him in
the afternoon. A great salient of a hill overhung
it, and on the near side a fir wood crept close. He
looked about him, and as he rode kept his hand
upon his pistol. He did not think to meet an enemy
in strength, but there might be lurkers, men of the
countryside ready to fall upon stragglers from the
army that had passed that way. He had left behind
the crossroad when from in front, around the
jut of the hill, came four horsemen. He turned his
head. Others had started from the wood. He
made to ride on as though he were of their kindred
and cause, but hands were laid upon his bridle.</p>

<p>"Courier, no doubt&mdash;"</p>

<p>All turned into the narrow road. Half an hour's
riding brought in sight a substantial farm-house and
about it the dimly flaring lights of a considerable
camp, both cavalry and infantry. Rullock supposed
it to be a detachment of Wade's, though it was possible
that the Duke of Cumberland might have
thrust advance troops thus far. He wished quite
heartily that something might occur to warn Lord
George Murray, the Macdonalds and the Prince's
guns, asleep at Shap. For himself, he might, if he
chose, pick out among the glittering constellations
a shape like a scaffold.</p>

<p>When he dismounted he was brought past a
bivouac fire and a coming and going of men afoot
and on horseback, into the farm-house, where two
or three officers sat at table. Questioned, threat<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>ened,
and re-questioned, he had of course nothing
to divulge. The less pressure was brought in that
these troops were in possession of the facts which
the moment desired. His name and rank he gave,
it being idle to withhold them. In the end he was
shut alone into a small room of the farm-house,
behind a guarded door. He saw that there was
planned an attack upon the detachment that with
dawn would move from Shap. But this force of
Wade's or of the Duke's was itself a detachment
and apparently of no great mass. He could only
hope that Lord George and the Macdonalds would
move warily and when the shock came be found
equal. All that was beyond his control. In the
chill darkness he turned to the consideration of his
own affair, which seemed desperate enough. He
found, by groping, a bench against the wall. Wrapping
himself in his cloak, he lay down upon this
and tried to sleep, but could not. With all his will
he closed off the future, and then as best he might
the immediately environing present. After all,
these armies&mdash;these struggles&mdash;these eery ambitions....
The feeling of <i>out of it</i> crept over him. It was an
unfamiliar perception, impermanent. Yet it might
leave a trace to work in the under-consciousness, on
a far day to emerge, be revalued and added to.</p>

<p>This December air! Fire would be good&mdash;and
with that thought he seemed to catch a gleam
through the small-paned, small window, and in a
moment through the opening door. He rose from
the bench. A man in a long cloak entered the room,
behind him a soldier bearing a lantern which he
set upon a shelf above a litter of boards and kegs.
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>Dismissed by a gesture, he went out, shutting the
door behind him. The first man dropped his
cloak, drew a heavy stool from the thrust-aside
lumber, and sat down beneath the lantern. He
spoke:</p>

<p>"Of all our many meeting-places, this looks most
like the old cave in the glen!"</p>

<p>Ian moistened his lips. He resumed his seat
against the wall. "I wondered, after Prestonpans,
if you went home."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"No, you are right. I did not."</p>

<p>"At all times it is the liar's wont still to lie.
Small things or great&mdash;use or no use!"</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner and unarmed. You are the
captor. To insult lies in your power."</p>

<p>"That is a jargon that may be dropped between
us. Yet I, too, am bound by conventions! Seeing
that you are a prisoner, and not my prisoner only, I
cannot give you your sword or pistols, and we cannot
fight.... The fighting, too, is a convention. I
see that, and that it is not adequate. Yet so do
I hold you in hatred that I would destroy you in
this poor way also!"</p>

<p>The two sat not eight feet apart. Time was when
either, finding himself in deadly straits, would have
seen in the other a sure rescuer, or a friend to perish
with him. One would have come to the other in a
burst of light and warmth. So countless were the
associations between them, so much knowledge, after
all, did they have of each other, that even now, if
they hated and contended, it must be, as it were, a
contention within an orb. To each hemisphere, re<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>pelling
the other, must yet come in lightning flashes
the face of the whole.</p>

<p>Glenfernie, under the lantern-light, looked like
the old laird his father. "No long time ago," he
said, "'revenge,' 'vengeance,' seemed to me words
of a low order! It was not so in my boyhood.
Then they were often to me passionate, immediate,
personal, and vindicated words! But it grew to be
that they appeared words of a low order. It is not
so now. As far as that goes I am younger than I
was a year ago. I stand in a hot, bright light where
they are vindicated. If fate sets you free again,
yet I do not set you free! I shall be after you. I
entered this place to tell you that."</p>

<p>"Do as you will!" answered Ian. Scorn mounted
in his voice. "I shall withstand the shock of you!"</p>

<p>The net of name and form hardened, grew more
iron and closer meshed. Each <i>I</i> contracted, made
its carapace thicker. Each <i>I</i> bestrode, like Apollyon,
the path of the other.</p>

<p>"Why should I undertake to defend myself?" said
Ian. "I do not undertake to do so! So at least I
shall escape the hypocrite! It is in the nature of
man to put down other kings and be king himself!"</p>

<p>"Aye so? The prime difficulty in that is that the
others, too, are immortal." Glenfernie rising, his
great frame seemed to fill the little room. "Sooner
may the Kelpie's Pool sink into the earth than I
forego to give again to you what you have given!
What is now all my wish? It is to seem to you,
here and hereafter, the avenger of blood and fraud!
Remember me so!"</p>

<p>He stood looking at the sometime friend with a
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>dark and working face. Then, abruptly turning, he
went away. The door of the small room closed behind
him. Ian heard the bolt driven.</p>

<p>The night went leadenly by. At last he slept,
and was waked by trumpets blowing. He saw
through the window that it was at faintest dawn.
Much later the door opened and a man brought
him a poor breakfast. Rullock questioned him, but
could gain nothing beyond the statement that to-day
at latest the "rebels" would be wiped from the
face of the earth. When he was gone Ian climbed
to the small window that, even were it open and
unguarded, was yet too small for his body to pass.
But, working with care, he managed to loosen and
draw inward without noise one of the round panes.
Outside lay a trampled farm-yard. A few soldiers,
apparently invalided, lounged about, but there was
no such throng such as he had passed through when
they brought him here. He supposed that the attack
upon the force at Shap might be in progress.
If the Duke of Cumberland's whole power was at
hand the main column might be set upon. All
around him the hills, the farm inclosure, and these
petty walls cut off the outer world. The hours, the
day, limped somehow by. He walked to keep himself
warm. Back and forth and to and fro. December&mdash;December&mdash;December!
How cold was the
Kelpie's Pool? Poisoned love&mdash;poisoned friendship&mdash;ambition
in ruin&mdash;bells ringing for executions!
To and fro&mdash;to and fro. He had always felt life
as sensuous, rich, and warm, with garlands and
colors. It had been large and aglow, with a profusion
of arabesques of imagination and emotion.
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>Thought had not lacked, but thought, too, bore a
personal, passional cast, and was much interested
in a golden world of sense. Just this December day
the world seemed the ocean-bed of life, where dull
creatures moved slowly in cold, thick ooze, and
annihilation was much to be desired.... The day
went by. The same man brought him supper.
There seemed to be triumph in his face. "They'll
be bringing in more prisoners&mdash;unless we
don't make prisoners!" Nothing more could be
gained from that quarter. In the night it began
to rain. He listened to its dash against the
window. Black Hill came into mind, and the rain
against his windows there. He was cold, and he
tried, with the regressive sense, to feel himself in
that old, warm nest. His Black Hill room rose about
him, firelit. The fire lighted that Italian painting
of a city of refuge and a fleeing man, behind whom
ran the avenger of blood.... Then it was July, and
he was in the glen with Elspeth Barrow. He fought
away from the recollection of that, for it involved
a sickness of the soul.... Italy! Think of Italy.
Venice, and a month that he had spent there alone&mdash;Old
Steadfast being elsewhere. It had been a
warm season, warm and rich, sun-kissed and languorous,
like the fruit, like the Italian women....
Leave out the women, but try to feel again the sun
of Venice!</p>

<p>He tried, but the cold of his prison fought with
the sun. Then suddenly sprang clamor without.
The uproar increased. He rose, he heard the bolts
open, the door open. In came light and voices.
"Captain Rullock! We beat them at Clifton! We
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>learned that you were here! Lord George sent us
back for you...."</p>

<p>Three days later Scotch earth was again beneath
their feet. They marched to Glasgow; they marched
to Stirling; they fought the battle of Falkirk and
again there was Jacobite victory. And now there
was an army of eight thousand.... And then began
a time of poor policy, mistaken moves. And in
April befell the battle of Culloden and far-resounding
ruin.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>The green May rolled around and below the
Highland shelter where Ian lay, fugitive, like
thousands of others, after Culloden. The Prince
had stayed to give an order to his broken army.
<i>Sauve qui peut!</i> Then he, too, became a fugitive,
passing from one fastness to another of these glens
and the mountains that overtowered them. The
Stewart hope was sunk in the sea of dead hopes.
Cumberland, with for the time and place a great
force and with an ugly fury, hunted all who had been
in arms against King George.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock couched high upon a mountain-side,
in a shelter of stone and felled tree built in an angle
of crag, screened by a growth of birch and oak,
made long ago against emergencies. A path, devious
and hidden, connected it first with a hut far
below, and then, at several miles' distance, with the
house of a chieftain, now a house of terror, with
the chieftain in prison and his sons in hiding, and
the women watching with hard-beating hearts. Ian,
a kinsman of the house, had been given, <i>faute de
mieux</i>, this old, secret hold, far up, where at least
he could see danger if it approached. Food had been
stored for him here and sheepskins given for bedding.
He was so masked by splintered and fallen pieces of
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>rock that he might, with great precautions, kindle
a fire. A spring like a fairy cup gave him water.
More than one rude comfort had been provided.
He had even a book or two, caught up from his kinsman's
small collection. He had been here fourteen
days.</p>

<p>At first they were days and nights of vastly needed
rest. Bitter had been the fatigue, privation, wandering,
immediately after Culloden! Now he was
rested.</p>

<p>He was by nature sanguine. When the sun had
irretrievably blackened and gone out he might be
expected at least to attempt to gather materials
and ignite another. He was capable of whistling
down the wind those long hopes of fame and fortune
that had hung around the Stewart star. And now
he was willing to let go the old half-acknowledged
boyish romance and sentiment, the glamour of the
imagination that had dressed the cause in hues not
its own. Two years of actual contact with the
present incarnations of that cause had worn the
sentiment threadbare.</p>

<p>Seated or lying upon the brown earth by the
splintered crag, alone save for the wheeling birds
and the sound of wind and water and the sailing
clouds, he had time at last for the rise into mind,
definitely shaped and visible, of much that had
been slowly brewing and forming. He was conscious
of a beginning of a readjustment of ideas.
For a long time now he had been pledged to personal
daring, to thought forced to become supple and concentrated,
to hard, practical planning, physical
hardship and danger. In the midst of this had be<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>gun
to grow up a criticism of all the enterprises upon
which he was engaged. Scope&mdash;in many respects
the Jacobite character, generally taken, was amiable
and brave, but its prime exhibit was not scope!
Somewhat narrow, somewhat obsolete; Ian's mind
now saw Jacobitism in that light. As he sat without
his rock fortress, in the shadow of birch-trees,
with lower hills and glens at his feet, he had a pale
vision of Europe, of the world. Countries and times
showed themselves contiguous. "Causes," dynastic
wars, political life, life in other molds and hues,
appeared in chords and sequences and strokes of
the eye, rather than in the old way of innumerable,
vivid, but faintly connected points. "I begin to
see," thought Ian, "how things travel together, like
with like!" His body was rested, recovered, his
mind invigorated. He had had with him for long
days the very elixir of solitude. Relations and associations
that before had been banked in ignorance
came forth and looked at him. "You surely have
known us before, though you had forgotten that
you knew us!" He found that he was taking delight
in these expansions of meaning. He thought, "If
I can get abroad out of this danger, out of old circles,
I'll roam and study and go to school to wider plans!"
He suddenly thought, "This kind of thing is what
Old Steadfast meant when he used to say that I
did not see widely enough." He moved sharply.
A hot and bitter flood seemed to well up within
him. "He himself is seeing narrowly now&mdash;Alexander
Jardine!"</p>

<p>He left the crag and went for a scrambling and
somewhat dangerous walk along the mountain-<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>side.
There was peril in leaving that one rock-curtained
place. Two days before he had seen
what he thought to be signs of red-coated soldiers
in the glen far below. But he must walk&mdash;he must
exercise his body, note old things, not give too
much time to new perceptions! He breathed the
keen, sweet mountain air; with a knife that he had
he fell to making a staff from a young oak; he
watched the pass below and the shadows of the
clouds; he climbed fairly to the mountain-top and
had a great view; he sang an old song, not aloud,
but under his breath; and at last he must come back
with solitude to his fastness. And here was brooding
thought again!</p>

<p>Two more days passed. The man from the hut
below in the pass came at dusk with food carefully
sent from the chieftain's hall. Redcoats had gone
indeed through the glen, but they could never find
the path to this place! They might return or they
might not; they were like the devil who rose by
your side when you were most peaceful! Angus
went down the mountain-side. The sound of his
footstep died away. Ian had again Solitude herself.</p>

<p>Another day and night passed. He watched the
sun climb toward noon, and as the day grew warm
he heard a step upon the hidden path. With a
pistol in either hand he moved, as stealthily, as silently
as might be, to a platform of rock that overhung
the way of the intruder. In another moment the
latter was in sight&mdash;one man climbing steadily the
path to the old robber fastness. He saw that it
was Glenfernie. No one followed him. He came
on alone.</p>

<p><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>Rullock put by his pistols and, moving to a chair
of rock, sat there. The other's great frame rose
level with him, stepped upon the rocky floor. Ian
had been growing to feel an anger at solitude. When
he saw Alexander he had not been able to check an
inner movement of welcome. He felt an old&mdash;he
even felt a new&mdash;affection for the being upon whom,
certainly, he had leaned. There flowed in, in an
impatient wave, the consideration that he must
hate....</p>

<p>But Glenfernie hated. Ian rose to face him.</p>

<p>"So you've found your way to my castle? It is
a climb! You had best sit and rest yourself. I have
my sword now, and I will give you satisfaction."</p>

<p>Glenfernie nodded. He sat upon a piece of fallen
rock. "Yes, I will rest first, thank you! I have
searched since dawn, and the mountain is steep.
Besides, I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Ian brought from his cupboard oat-cake and a
flask of brandy. The other shook his head.</p>

<p>"I had food at sunrise, and I drank from a spring
below."</p>

<p>"Very good!"</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie sat looking down the
mountain-sides and over to far hills and moving
clouds, much as he used to sit in the crook of the
old pine outside the broken wall at Glenfernie.
There was a trick of posture when he was at certain
levels within himself. Ian knew it well.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should tell you," said Alexander,
"that I came alone through the pass and that I
have been alone for some days. If there are soldiers
near I do not know of them."</p>

<p><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>"It is not necessary," answered Ian. While he
spoke he saw in a flash both that his confidence was
profound that it was not necessary, and that that
incapacity to betray that might be predicated of
Old Steadfast was confined to but one of the two
upon this rock. The enlightenment stung, then
immediately brought out a reaction. "To each
some specialty in error! I no more than he am
monstrous!" There arose a desire to defend himself,
to show Old Steadfast certain things. He spoke.
"We are going to fight presently&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's understood. Now listen to me a little!
For long years we were together, friends near and
warm! You knew that I saw differently from you
in regard to many things&mdash;in regard, for instance, to
women. I remember old discussions.... Well, you
differed, and sometimes you were angry. But for
all that, friendship never went out with violence!
You knew the ancient current that I swam in&mdash;that
it was narrower, more mixed with earth, than your
own! But you were tolerant. You took me as I
was.... What has developed was essentially there
then, and you knew it. The difference is that at
last it touched what you held to be your own.
Then, and not till then, the sinner became <i>anathema!</i>"</p>

<p>"In some part you say truth. But my load of
inconsistency does not lighten yours of guilt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. We were friends. Five-sixths of
me made a fair enough friend and comrade. We
interlocked. You had gifts and possessions I had
not. I liked the oak-feeling of you&mdash;the great ship
in sail! In turn, I had the key, perhaps, to a few
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>lands of bloom and flavor that you lacked. We
interchanged and thought that we were each the
richer. Five-sixths.... Say, then, that the other
sixth might be defined as no-friend, or as false
friend! Say that it was wilful, impatient of superiorities,
proud, vain, willing to hurt, betray, and
play the demon generally! Say that once it gave
itself swing it darkened some of the other sixths....
Well, it is done! Yet there was gold. Perhaps,
laird of Glenfernie, there is still gold in the mine!"</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in your proportions. Gold!
You are to me the specter of the Kelpie's Pool!"</p>

<p>Silence held for a minute or two. The clouds,
passing between earth and sun, made against the
mountain slopes impalpable, dark, fantastic shapes.
An eagle wheeled above its nest at the mountain-top.
Ian spoke again. His tone had altered.</p>

<p>"If I do not decline remorse, I at least decline
the leaden cope of it you would have me wear!
There is such a thing as fair play to oneself! Two
years ago come August Elspeth Barrow and I agreed
to part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'agreed'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have it so! I said that we must part. She
acquiesced&mdash;and that without the appeals that the
stage and literature show us. Oh, doubtless I
might have seen a pierced spirit, and did not, and
was brute beast there! But one thing you have got
to believe, and that is that neither of us knew what
was to happen. Even with that, she was aware of
how a letter might be sent, with good hope of reaching
me. She was not a weak, ignorant girl.... I
went away, and within a fortnight was deep in that
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>long attempt that ends here. I became actively an
agent for the Prince and his father. A hundred
names and their fates were in my hands. You can
fill in the multitude of activities, each seeming small
in itself, but the whole preoccupying every field....
If Elspeth Barrow wrote I never received her
letter. When my thought turned in that direction,
it saw her well and not necessarily unhappy. Time
passed. For reasons, I ceased to write home, and
again for reasons I obliterated paths by which I
might be reached. For months I heard nothing,
as I said nothing. I was on the very eve of quitting
Paris, under careful disguise, to go into Scotland.
Came suddenly your challenge&mdash;and still, though I
knew that to you at least our relations must have
been discovered, I knew no more than that! I did
not know that she was dead.... I could not stay to
fight you then. I left you to brand me as you
pleased in your mind."</p>

<p>"I had already branded you."</p>

<p>"Later, I saw that you had. Perhaps then I
did not wonder. In September&mdash;almost a year
from that Christmas Eve&mdash;I yet did not know.
Then, in Edinburgh, I came upon Mr. Wotherspoon.
He told me.... I had no wicked intent toward
Elspeth Barrow&mdash;none according to my canon,
which has been that of the natural man. We met
by accident. We loved at once and deeply. She
had in her an elf queen! But at last the human
must have darkened and beset her. Had I known of
those fears, those dangers, I might have turned homeward
from France and every shining scheme...."</p>

<p>"Ah no, you would not&mdash;"</p>

<p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>"... If I would not, then certainly I should have
written to Jarvis Barrow and to others, acknowledging
my part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would have done that. Perhaps
not. You might have found reasons of obligation
for not doing so. 'Loved deeply'! You never
loved her deeply! You have loved nothing deeply
save yourself!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Yet I think," said Ian, "that I would
have done as much as that. But Alexander Jardine,
of course, would not have taken one erring
step!"</p>

<p>"Have you done now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Glenfernie rose to his feet. He stood against the
gulf of air and his great frame seemed enlarged,
like the figure of the Brocken. He was like his
father, the old laird, but there glowed an extremer
dark anger and power. The old laird had made
himself the dream-avenger of injuries adopted, not
felt at first hand. The present laird knew the
wounding, the searing. "All his life my father
dreamed of grappling with Grierson of Lagg. My
Grierson of Lagg stands before me in the guise of a
false friend and lover!... What do I care for your
weighing to a scruple how much the heap of wrong
falls short of the uttermost? The dire wrong is
there, to me the direst! Had I deep affection for
you once? Now you speak to me of every treacherous
morass, every <i>ignis fatuus</i>, past and present!
The traveler through life does right to drain the
bogs as they arise&mdash;put it out of their power to suck
down man, woman, and child! It is not his cause
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>alone. It is the general cause. If there be a God,
He approves. Draw your sword and let us fight!"</p>

<p>They fought. The platform of rock was smooth
enough for good footing. They had no seconds, unless
the shadows upon the hills and the mountain
eagles answered for such. Ian was the highly trained
fencer, adept of the sword. Glenfernie's knowledge
was lesser, more casual. But he had his bleak
wrath, a passion that did not blind nor overheat,
but burned white, that set him, as it were, in a
tingling, crackling arctic air, where the shadows
were sharp-edged, the nerves braced and the will
steel-tipped. They fought with determination and
long&mdash;Ian now to save his own life, Alexander for
Revenge, whose man he had become. The clash of
blade against blade, the shifting of foot upon the
rock floor, made the dominant sound upon the
mountain-side. The birds stayed silent in the birch-trees.
Self-service, pride, anger, jealousy, hatred&mdash;the
inner vibrations were heavy.</p>

<p>The sword of Ian beat down his antagonist's
guard, leaped, and gave a deep wound. Alexander's
sword fell from his hand. He staggered and vision
darkened. He came to his knees, then sank upon
the ground. Ian bent over him. He felt his anger
ebb. A kind of compunction seized him. He
thought, "Are you so badly hurt, Old Steadfast?"</p>

<p>Alexander looked at him. His lips moved. "Lo,
how the wicked prosper! But do you think that
Justice will have it so?" The blood gushed; he sank
back in a swoon.</p>

<p>On this mountain-side, some distance below the
fastness, a stone, displaced by a human foot, rolled
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>down the slope with a clattering sound. The fugitive
above heard it, thought, too, that he caught other
sounds. He crossed to the nook whence he had view
of the way of approach. Far down he saw the redcoats,
and then, much nearer, coming out from
dwarf woods, still King George's men.</p>

<p>Ian caught up his belt and pistols. He sheathed
his sword. "They'll find you and save you, Glenfernie!
I do not think that you will die!" Above
him sprang the height of crag, seemingly unscalable.
But he had been shown the secret, just possible stair.
He mounted it. Masked by bushes, it swung around
an abutment and rose by ledge and natural tunnel,
perilous and dizzy, but the one way out to safety.
At last, a hundred feet above the old shelter, he
dipped over the crag head to a saucer-like depression
walled from all redcoat view by the surmounted
rock. With a feeling of triumph he plunged
through small firs and heather, and, passing the
mountain brow, took the way that should lead him
to the next glen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>The laird of Glenfernie, rising from the great
chair by the table, moved to the window of the
room that had been his father's and mother's, the
room where both had died. He remembered the
wild night of snow and wind in which his father
had left the body. Now it was August, and the
light golden upon the grass and the pilgrim cedar.
Alexander walked slowly, with a great stick under
his hand. Old Bran was dead, but a young Bran
stretched himself, wagged his tail, and looked beseechingly
at the master.</p>

<p>"I'll let you out," said the latter, "but I am a
prisoner; I cannot let myself out!"</p>

<p>He moved haltingly to the door, opened it, and
the dog ran forth. Glenfernie returned to the window.
"Prisoner." The word brought to his strongly
visualizing mind prisoners and prisons through
all Britain this summer&mdash;shackled prisoners, dark
prisons, scaffolds.... He leaned his head against
the window-frame.</p>

<p>"O God that my father and my grandfather
served&mdash;God of old times&mdash;of Israel in Egypt! I
think that I would release them all if I could&mdash;<i>all
but one! Not him!</i>" He looked at the cedar.
"Who was he, in truth, who planted that, perhaps
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>for a remembrance? And he, and all men, had
and have some one deep wrong that shall not be
brooked!"</p>

<p>He stood in a brown study until there was a tap
at the door. "Come in!"</p>

<p>Alice entered, bearing before her a bowl of flowers
of all fair hues and shapes. She herself was like a
bright, strong, winsome flower. "To make your
room look bonny!" she said, and placed the bowl
upon the table. To do so she pushed aside the
books. "What a withered, snuff-brown lot! Won't
you be glad when you are back in the keep with all
the books?"</p>

<p>Glenfernie, wrapped in a brown gown, came with
his stick back to the great chair before the books.
"Bonny&mdash;they are bonny!" he said and touched the
flowers. "I've set a week from to-day to be dressed
and out of this and back to the keep. Another week,
and I shall ride Black Alan."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Alice. "You mustn't determine that
you can do it all yourself! There will be the doctor
and the wound!"</p>

<p>Alexander took her hands and held them. "You
are a fine philosopher! Where is Strickland?"</p>

<p>"Helping Aunt Grizel with accounts. Do you
want him?"</p>

<p>"When you go. But not for a long while if you
will stay."</p>

<p>Alice regarded him with her mother's shrewdness.
"Oh, Glenfernie, for all you've traveled and are so
learned, it's not me nor Mr. Strickland, but the
moon now that you're wanting! I don't know what
your moon is, but it's the moon!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>Alexander laughed. "And is not the moon a
beautiful thing?"</p>

<p>"The books say that it is cold and almost dead,
wrinkled and ashen. But I've got to go," said
Alice, "and I'll send you Mr. Strickland."</p>

<p>Strickland came presently. "You look much
stronger this morning, Glenfernie. I'm glad of that!
Shall I read to you, or write?"</p>

<p>"Read, I think. My eyes dazzle still when I
try. Some strong old thing&mdash;the Plutarch there.
Read the <i>Brutus</i>."</p>

<p>Strickland read. He thought that now Alexander
listened, and that now he had traveled afar. The
minutes passed. The flowers smelled sweetly, murmuring
sounds came in the open windows. Bran
scratched at the door and was admitted. Far off,
Alice's voice was heard singing. Strickland read
on. The laird of Glenfernie was not at Rome, in
the Capitol, by Pompey's statue. He walked with
Elspeth Barrow the feathery green glen.</p>

<p>Davie appeared in the door. "A letter, sir, come
post." He brought it to Glenfernie's outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"From Edinburgh&mdash;from Jamie," said the latter.</p>

<p>Strickland laid down his book and moved to the
window. Standing there, his eyes upon the great
cedar, massive and tall as though it would build
a tower to heaven, his mind left Brutus, C&aelig;sar, and
Cassius, and played somewhat idly over the British
Isles. He was recalled by an exclamation, not loud,
but so intense and fierce that it startled like a meteor
of the night. He turned. Glenfernie sat still in his
great chair, but his features were changed, his mouth
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>working, his eyes shooting light. Strickland advanced
toward him.</p>

<p>"Not bad news of Jamie!"</p>

<p>"Not of Jamie! From Jamie." He thrust the
letter under the other's eyes. "Read&mdash;read it
out!"</p>

<p>Strickland read aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here is authoritative news. Ian Rullock, after lying two
months in the tolbooth, has escaped. A gaoler connived, it is
supposed, else it would seem impossible. Galbraith tells me he
would certainly have been hanged in September. It is thought
that he got to Leith and on board a ship. Three cleared that
day&mdash;for Rotterdam, for Lisbon, and Virginia."</p></div>

<p>Alexander took the letter again. "That is all of
that import." Strickland once more felt astonishment.
Glenfernie's tone was quiet, almost matter-of-fact.
The blood had ebbed from his face; he
sat there collected, a great quiet on the heels of
storm. It was impossible not to admire the power
that could with such swiftness exercise control.
Strickland hesitated. He wished to speak, but did
not know how far he might with wisdom. The
laird forestalled him.</p>

<p>"Sit down! This is to be talked over, for again
my course of life alters."</p>

<p>Strickland took his chair. He leaned his arm
upon the table, his chin upon his hand. He did
not look directly at the man opposite, but at the
bowl of flowers between them.</p>

<p>"When a man has had joy and lost it, what does
he do?" Glenfernie's voice was almost contemplative.</p>

<p><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>"One man one thing, and one another," said
Strickland. "After his nature."</p>

<p>"No. All go seeking it in the teeth of death and
horror. That's universal! Joy must be sought.
But it may not wear the old face; it may wear
another."</p>

<p>"I suppose that true joy has one face."</p>

<p>"When one platonizes&mdash;perhaps! I keep to-day
to earth, to the cave. Do you know," said Alexander,
"why I sit here wounded?"</p>

<p>"Of outward facts I do not know any more than
is, I think, pretty generally known through this
countryside."</p>

<p>"As&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Strickland looked still at the bowl of flowers.
"It is known, I think, that you loved Elspeth Barrow
and would have wedded her. And that, while
you were from home, the man who called himself,
and was called by you, your nearest friend, stepped
before you&mdash;made love to her, betrayed her&mdash;and
left her to bear the shame.... I myself know that
he kept you in ignorance, and that, away from here,
he let you still write to him in friendship and answered
in that tone.... All know that she drowned
herself because of him, and that you knew naught
until you yourself entered the Kelpie's Pool and
found her body and carried her home.... After that
you left the country to find and fight Ian Rullock.
Folk know, too, that he evaded you then. You returned.
Then came this insurrection, and news
that he was in Scotland with the Pretender. You
joined the King's forces. Then, after Culloden,
you found the false friend in hiding, in the moun<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>tains.
The two of you fought, and, as is often the
way, the injurer seemed again to win. You were
dangerously wounded. He fled. Soldiers upon his
track found you lying in your blood. You were
carried to Inverness. Dickson and I went to you,
brought you at last home. In the mean time came
news that the man you fought had been taken by
the soldiers. I suppose that we have all had
visions of him, in prison, expecting to suffer with
other conspirators."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have had visions ... outward facts!... Do
you know the inner, northern ocean, where sleep
all the wrecks?"</p>

<p>"As I have watched you since you were a boy,
it is improbable that I should not have some divining
power. In Inverness, too, while you were fevered,
you talked and talked.... You have walked
with Tragedy, felt her net and her strong whip."
Strickland lifted his eyes from the bowl, pushed
back his chair a little, and looked full at the laird
of Glenfernie. "What then? Rise, Glenfernie, and
leave her behind! And if you do not now, it will
soon be hard for you to do so! Remember, too,
that I watched your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After I find Ian Rullock in Holland or Lisbon
or America&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strickland made a movement of deep concern.
"You have met and fought this man. Do you mean
so to nourish vengeance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean so to aid and vindicate distressed Justice."</p>

<p>"Is it the way?"</p>

<p>"I think that it is the way."</p>

<p><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>Strickland was silent, seeing the uselessness.
Glenfernie was one to whom conviction must come
from within. A stillness held in the room, broken
by the laird in the voice that was growing like his
father's. "Nothing lacks now but strength, and I
am gaining that&mdash;will gain it the faster now! Travel&mdash;travel!... All
my travel was preparatory to this."</p>

<p>"Do you mean," asked Strickland, "to kill him
when you find him?"</p>

<p>"I like your directness. But I do not know&mdash;I
do not know!... I mean to be his following fiend.
To have him ever feel me&mdash;when he turns his head
ever to see me!"</p>

<p>The other sighed sharply. He thought to himself,
"Oh, mind, thy abysses!"</p>

<p>Indeed, Glenfernie looked at this moment stronger.
He folded Jamie's letter and put it by. He drew
the bowl of flowers to him and picked forth a rose.
"A week&mdash;two at most&mdash;and I shall be wholly recovered!"
His voice had fiber, decision, even a kind
of cheer.</p>

<p>Strickland thought, "It is his fancied remedy, at
which he snatches!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie continued: "We'll set to work to-morrow
upon long arrangements! With you to
manage here, I will not be missed." Without waiting
for the morrow he took quill and paper and
began to figure.</p>

<p>Strickland watched him. At last he said, "Will
you go at once in three ships to Holland, Portugal,
and America?"</p>

<p>"Has the onlooker room for irony, while to me it
looks so simple? I shall ship first to the likeliest
<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>land.... In ten days&mdash;in two weeks at most&mdash;to
Edinburgh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Strickland left him figuring and, rising, went to
the window. He saw the great cedar, and in mind
the pilgrim who planted it there. All the pilgrims&mdash;all
the crusaders&mdash;all the men in Plutarch; the
long frieze of them, the full ocean of them ... all
the self-search, dressed as search of another. "I,
too, I doubt not&mdash;I, too!" Buried scenes in his own
life rose before Strickland. Behind him scratched
Glenfernie's pen, sounded Glenfernie's voice:</p>

<p>"I am going to see presently if I can walk as far
as the keep. In two or three days I shall ride.
There are things that I shall know when I get to
Edinburgh. He would take, if he could, the ship
that would land him at the door of France."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Alexander rode across the moors to the glen
head. Two or three solitary farers that he met
gave him eager good day.</p>

<p>"Are ye getting sae weel, laird? I am glad o'
that!"</p>

<p>"Good day, Mr. Jardine! I rejoice to see you
recovered. Well, they hung more of them yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Gude day, Glenfernie! It's a bonny morn, and
sweet to be living!"</p>

<p>At noon he looked down on the Kelpie's Pool.
The air was sweet and fine, bird sounds came
from the purple heather. The great blue arch of
the sky smiled; even the pool, reflecting day, seemed
to have forgotten cold and dread. But for Glenfernie
a dull, cold, sick horror overspread the place.
He and Black Alan stood still upon the moor brow.
Large against the long, clean, horizon sweep, they
looked the sun-bathed, stone figures of horse and
man, set there long ago, guarding the moor, giving
warning of the kelpie.</p>

<p>"None has been found to warn. There is none
but the kelpie waits for.... But punish&mdash;punish!"</p>

<p>He and Black Alan pushed on to the head of the
glen. Here was Mother Binning's cot, and here he
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>dismounted, fastening the horse to the ash-tree.
Mother Binning was outdoors, gathering herbs in
her apron.</p>

<hr style='width: 33%;' />

<p>She straightened herself as he stepped toward her.
"Eh, laird of Glenfernie, ye gave me a start! I
thought ye came out of the ground by the ash-tree!... Wound
is healed, and life runs on to another
springtime?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's another springtime.... I do not think
that I believe in scrying, Mother Binning. But
I'm where I pick up all straws with which to
build me a nest! Sit down and scry for me, will
you?"</p>

<p>"I canna scry every day, nor every noon, nor
every year. What are you wanting to see, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just my soul's desire!"</p>

<p>Mother Binning turned to her door. She put
down the herbs, then brought a pan of water and
set it down upon the door-step, and herself beside
it. "It helps&mdash;onything that's still and clear!
Wait till the ripple's gane, and then dinna speak to
me. But gin I see onything, it will na be sae great
a thing as a soul's desire."</p>

<p>She sat still and he stood still, leaning against the
side of her house. Mother Binning sat with fixed
gaze. Her lips moved. "There's the white mist.
It's clearing."</p>

<p>"Tell me if you see a ship."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see it...."</p>

<p>"Tell me if you see its port."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see."</p>

<p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>"Describe it&mdash;the houses, the country, the dress
and look of the people&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mother Binning did so.</p>

<p>"That's not Holland&mdash;that would be Lisbon.
Look at the ship again, Mother. Look at the
sailors. Look at the passengers if there are any.
Whom do you see?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mother Binning. "There's a braw
wrong-doer for you, sitting drinking Spanish wine!"</p>

<p>"Say his name."</p>

<p>"It's he that once, when you were a lad, you
brought alive from the Kelpie's Pool."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mother! That's what I wanted.
<i>Scrying!</i> Who gives to whom&mdash;who gives back to
whom? The underneath great I, I suppose. Left
hand giving to right&mdash;and no brand-new news!
All the same, other drifts concurring, I think that
he fled by the Lisbon ship!"</p>

<p>Mother Binning pushed aside the pan of water
and rubbed her hand across her eyes. She took up
her bundle of herbs. "Hoot, Glenfernie! do ye
think that's your soul's desire?"</p>

<p>Jock came limping around the house. Alexander
could not now abide the sight of this cripple
who had spied, and had not shot some fashion of
arrow! He said good-by and loosed Black Alan
from the ash-tree and rode away. He would not
tread the glen. His memory recoiled from it as
from some Eastern glen of serpents. He and Black
Alan went over the moors. And still it was early
and he had his body strength back. He rode to
Littlefarm.</p>

<p>Robin Greenlaw was in the field, coat off in the
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>gay, warm weather. He came to Glenfernie's side,
and the latter dismounted and sat with him under
a tree. Greenlaw brought a stone jug and tankard
and poured ale.</p>

<p>The laird drank. "That's good, Robin!" He put
down the tankard. "Are you still a poet?"</p>

<p>"If I was so once upon a time, I hope I am so
still. At any rate, I still make verses. And I see
poems that I can never write."</p>

<p>"'Never'&mdash;how long a word that is!"</p>

<p>Greenlaw gazed at the workers in the field. "I
met Mr. Strickland the other day. He says that
you will travel again."</p>

<p>"'Travel'&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"The Jardine Arms gets it from the Edinburgh
road that Ian Rullock made a daring escape."</p>

<p>"He had always ingenuity and a certain sort of
physical bravery."</p>

<p>"So has Lucifer, Milton says. But he's not
Lucifer."</p>

<p>"No. He is weak and small."</p>

<p>"Well, look Glenfernie! I would not waste my
soul chasing him!"</p>

<p>"How dead are you all! You, too, Greenlaw!"</p>

<p>Robin flushed. "No! I hate all that he did that
is vile! If all his escaping leads him to violent
death, I shall not find it in me to grieve! But all
the same, I would not see you narrowed to the wolf-hunter
that will never make the wolf less than the
wolf! I don't know. I've always thought of you
as one who would serve Wisdom and show us her
beauty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To me this is now wisdom&mdash;this is now beauty.
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>Poets may stay and make poetry, but I go after
Ian Rullock!"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's poetry in that, too," said Greenlaw,
"because there's nothing in which there isn't
poetry! But you're choosing the kind you're not
best in, or so it seems to me."</p>

<p>Glenfernie rode from Littlefarm homeward. But
the next day he and Black Alan went to Black
Hill. Here he saw Mr. Touris alone. That gentleman
sat with a shrunken and shriveled look.</p>

<p>"Eh, Glenfernie! I am glad to see that you are
yourself again! Well, my sister's son has broken
prison."</p>

<p>"Yes, one prison."</p>

<p>"God knows they were all mad! But I could not
wish to see him in my dreams, hanging dark from
the King's gallows!"</p>

<p>"From the King's gallows and for old, mad,
Stewart hopes? I find," said Glenfernie, "that I
do not wish that, either. He would have gone for
the lesser thing&mdash;and the long true, right vengeance
been delayed!"</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Mr. Touris, dully.</p>

<p>"His wrong shall be ever in his mind, and I the
painter's brush to paint it there! Give me, O God,
the power of genius!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to follow him and kill him?"</p>

<p>"I am going to follow him. At first I thought
that I would kill him. But my mind is changing
as to that."</p>

<p>Mr. Touris sighed heavily. "I don't know what is
the matter with the world.... One does one's best,
but all goes wrong. All kinds of hopes and plans.<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>... When
I look back to when I was a young man,
I wonder.... I set myself an aim in life, to lift me
and mine from poverty. I saved for it, denied for
it, was faithful. It came about and it's ashes in
my mouth! Yet I took it as a trust, and was faithful.
What does the Bible say, 'Vanity of vanities'?
But I say that the world's made wrong."</p>

<p>Glenfernie left him at last, wrinkled and shrunken
and shriveled, cold on a summer day, plying himself
with wine, a serving-man mending the fire upon
the hearth. Alexander went to Mrs. Alison's parlor.
He found her deep chair placed in the garden
without, and she herself sitting there, a book in
hand, but not read, her form very still, her eyes
upon a shaft of light that was making vivid a row
of flowers. The book dropped beside her on the
grass; she rose quickly. The last time they had
met was before Culloden, before Prestonpans.</p>

<p>She came to him. "You're well, Alexander!
Thanks be! Sit down, my dear, sit down!" She
would have made him take her chair, but he laughed
and brought one for himself from the room. "I
bless my ancestors for a physical body that will
not keep wounds!"</p>

<p>She sank into her chair again and sat in silence,
gazing at him. Her clear eyes filled with tears,
but she shook them away. At last she spoke:
"Oh, I see the other sort of wounds! Alexander!
lay hold of the nature that will make them, too,
to heal!"</p>

<p>"Saint Alison," he answered, "look full at what
went on. Now tell me if those are wounds easy
to heal. And tell me if he were not less than a
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>man who pocketed the injury, who said to the injurer,
'Go in peace!'"</p>

<p>She looked at him mournfully. "Is it to pocket
the injury? Will not all combine&mdash;silently, silently&mdash;to
teach him at last? Less than man&mdash;man&mdash;more
than man, than to-day's appearing man?... I
am not wise. For yourself and the ring of your
moment you may be judging inevitably, rightly.... But
with what will you overcome&mdash;and in overcoming
what will you overcome?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience. "Oh, friend,
once I, too, could be metaphysical! I cannot now."</p>

<p>Speech failed between them. They sat with
eyes upon the garden, the old tree, the August blue
sky, but perhaps they hardly saw these. At last
she turned. She had a slender, still youthful
figure, an oval, lovely, still young face. Now there
was a smile upon her lips, and in her eyes a light
deep, touching, maternal.</p>

<p>"Go as you will, hunt him as you will, do what
you will! And he, too&mdash;Ian! Ian and his sins.
Grapes in the wine-press&mdash;wheat beneath the flail&mdash;ore
in the ardent fire, and over all the clouds of
wrath! Suffering and making to suffer&mdash;sinning
and making to sin.... And yet will the dawn come,
and yet will you be reconciled!"</p>

<p>"Not while memory holds!"</p>

<p>"Ah, there is so much to remember! Ian has so
much and you have so much.... When the great
memory comes you will see. But not now, it is
apparent, not now! So go if you will and must,
Alexander, with the net and the spear!"</p>

<p>"Did he not sin?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I also sin. But my sin does not match his!
God makes use of instruments, and He shall make
use of me!"</p>

<p>"If He 'shall,' then He shall. Let us leave talk
of this. Where you go may love and light go, too&mdash;and
work it out, and work it out!"</p>

<p>He did not stay long in her garden. All Black
Hill oppressed him now. The dark crept in upon
the light. She saw that it was so.</p>

<p>"He can be friends now with none. He sees in
each one a partisan&mdash;his own or Ian's." She did
not detain him, but when he rose to say good-by
helped him to say it without delay.</p>

<p>He went, and she paced her garden, thinking of
Ian who had done so great wrong, and Alexander
who cried, "My enemy!" She stayed in the garden
an hour, and then she turned and went to play
piquet with the lonely, shriveled man, her brother.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>Two days after this Glenfernie rode to White
Farm. Jenny Barrow met him with exclamations.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Alexander! Oh, Glenfernie! And they
say that you are amaist as weel as ever&mdash;but to
me you look twelve years older! Eh, and this
warld has brought gray into <i>my</i> hair! Father's gane
to kirk session, and Gilian's awa'."</p>

<p>He sat down beside her. Her hands went on
paring apples, while her eyes and tongue were
busy elsewhere.</p>

<p>"They say you're gaeing to travel."</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm starting very soon."</p>

<p>"It's na <i>said oot</i>&mdash;but a kind of whisper's been
gaeing around." She hesitated, then, "Are you
gaeing after him, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Jenny put down her knife and apple. She drew
a long breath, so that her bosom heaved under her
striped gown. A bright color came into her cheeks.
She laughed. "Aweel, I wadna spare him if I were
you!"</p>

<p>He sat with her longer than he had done with
Mrs. Alison. He felt nearer to her. He could be
friends with her, while he moved from the other as
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>from a bloodless wraith. Here breathed freely all
the strong vindications! He sat, sincere and strong,
and sincere and strong was the countrywoman beside
him.</p>

<p>"Oh aye!" said Jenny. "He's a villain, and I
wad gie him all that he gave of villainy!"</p>

<p>"That is right," said Alexander, "to look at it
simply!" He felt that those were his friends who
felt in this as did he.</p>

<p>On the moor, riding homeward, he saw before
him Jarvis Barrow. Dismounting, he met the old
man beside a cairn, placed there so long ago that
there was only an elfin story for the deeds it commemorated.</p>

<p>"Gude day, Glenfernie! So that Hieland traitor
did not slay ye?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow, white-headed, strong-featured, far
yet, it seemed, from incapacitating old age, took his
seat upon a great stone loosened from the mass.
He leaned upon his staff; his collie lay at his feet.
"Many wad say a lang time, with the healing in it
of lang time, since a fause lover sang in the ear of
my granddaughter, in the glen there!"</p>

<p>"Aye, many would say it."</p>

<p>"I say 'a fause lover.' But the ane to whom she
truly listened is an aulder serpent than he ... wae
to her!"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"But I say 'aye!' I am na weak! She that
worked evil and looseness, harlotry, strife, and
shame, shall she na have her hire? As, Sunday by
Sunday, I wad ha' set her in kirk, before the con<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>gregation,
for the stern rebuking of her sin, so, mak
no doubt, the Lord pursues her now! Aye, He shakes
His wrath before her eyes! Wherever she turns
she sees 'Fornicatress' writ in flames!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"But aye!"</p>

<p>"Where she was mistaken&mdash;where, maybe, she
was wilfully blind&mdash;she must learn. Not the learning
better, but the old mistake until it is lost in
knowledge, will clothe itself in suffering! But that
is but a part of her! If there is error within, there
is also Michael within to make it of naught! She
releases herself. It is horrible to me to see you
angered against her, for you do not discriminate&mdash;and
you are your Michael, but not hers!"</p>

<p>"Adam is speaking&mdash;still the woman's lover! I'm
not for contending with you. She tore my heart
working folly in my house, and an ill example, and
for herself condemnation!"</p>

<p>"Leave her alone! She has had great unhappiness!"
He moved the small stones of the cairn with
his fingers. "I am going away from Glenfernie."</p>

<p>"Aye. It was in mind that ye would! You and
he were great friends."</p>

<p>"The greater foes now."</p>

<p>"I gie ye full understanding there!"</p>

<p>"With my father, those he hated were beyond
his touch. So he walked among shadows only.
But to me this world is a not unknown wood where
roves, alive and insolent, my utter enemy! I can
touch him and I will touch him!"</p>

<p>"Not you, but the Lord Wha abides not evil!... How
sune will ye be gaeing, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>"As soon as I can ride far. As soon as everything
is in order here. I know that I am going, but I
do not know if I am returning."</p>

<p>"I haud na with dueling. It's un-Christian.
But mony's the ancient gude man that Jehovah
used for sword! Aye, and approved the sword that
he used&mdash;calling him faithful servant and man after
His heart! I am na judging."</p>

<p>From the moor Glenfernie rode through the village.
Folk spoke to him, looked after him; children
about the doors called to others, "It's tha
laird on Black Alan!" Old and young women, distaff
or pan or pot or pitcher in hand, turned head,
gazed, spoke to themselves or to one another. The
Jardine Arms looked out of doors. "He's unco like
tha auld laird!" Auld Willy, that was over a hundred,
raised a piping voice, "Did ye young things
remember Gawin Elliot that was his great-grandfather
ye'd be saying, 'Ye might think it was Gawin
Elliot that was hangit!'" Mrs. Macmurdo came to
her shop door. "Eh, the laird, wi' all the straw of
all that's past alight in his heart!"</p>

<p>Alexander answered the "good days," but he did
not draw rein. He rode slowly up the steep village
street and over the bare waste bit of hill until here
was the manse, with the kirk beyond it. Coming
out of the manse gate was the minister. Glenfernie
checked his mare. All around spread a bare and
lonely hilltop. The manse and the kirk and the
minister's figure buttressed each the others with a
grim strength. The wind swept around them and
around Glenfernie.</p>

<p>Mr. M'Nab, standing beside the laird, spoke
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>earnestly. "We rejoice, Glenfernie, that you are
about once more! There is the making in you of a
grand man, like your father. It would have been
down-spiriting if that son of Belial had again triumphed
in mischief. The weak would have found
it so."</p>

<p>"What is triumph?"</p>

<p>"Ye may well ask that! And yet," said M'Nab,
"I know. It is the warm-feeling cloak that Good
when it hath been naked wraps around it, seeing
the spoiler spoiled and the wicked fallen into the
pit that he digged!"</p>

<p>"Aye, the naked Good."</p>

<p>The minister looked afar, a dark glow and energy
in his thin face. "They are in prison, and the scaffolds
groan&mdash;they who would out with the Kirk
and a Protestant king and in with the French and
popery!"</p>

<p>"Your general wrong," said Glenfernie, "barbed
and feathered also for a Scots minister's own inmost
nerve! And is not my wrong general likewise?
Who hates and punishes falsity, though it were
found in his own self, acts for the common good!"</p>

<p>"Aye!" said the minister. "But there must be
assurance that God calls you and that you hate
the sin and not the sinner!"</p>

<p>"Who assures the assurances? Still it is I!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie rode on. Mr. M'Nab looked after him
with a darkling brow. "That was heathenish&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Alexander passed kirk and kirkyard. He went
home and sat in the room in the keep, under his
hand paper upon which he made figures, diagrams,
words, and sentences. When the next day came
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>he did not ride, but walked. He walked over the
hills, with the kirk spire before him lifting toward
a vast, blue serenity. Presently he came in sight
of the kirkyard, its gravestones and yew-trees.
He had met few persons upon the road, and here on
the hilltop held to-day a balmy silence and solitude.
As he approached the gate, to which there mounted
five ancient, rounded steps of stone, he saw sitting
on one of these a woman with a basket of flowers.
Nearer still, he found that it was Gilian Barrow.</p>

<p>She waited for him to come up to her. He took
his place upon the steps. All around hung still and
sunny space. The basket of flowers between them
was heaped with marigolds, pinks, and pansies.</p>

<p>"For Elspeth," said Gilian.</p>

<p>"It is almost two years. You have ceased to
grieve?"</p>

<p>"Ah no! But one learns how to marry grief and
gladness."</p>

<p>"Have you learned that? That is a long lesson.
But some are quicker than others or had learned
much beforehand.... Where is Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is safe, Glenfernie!"</p>

<p>"I wanted her body safe&mdash;safe, warm, in my
arms!"</p>

<p>"Spirit and spirit. Meet spirit with spirit!"</p>

<p>"No! I crave and hunger and am cold. Unless
I warm myself&mdash;unless I warm myself&mdash;with anger
and hatred!"</p>

<p>"I wish it were not so!"</p>

<p>"I had a friend.... I warm myself now in the
hunt of a foe&mdash;in his look when he sees me!"</p>

<p>Gilian smote her hands together. "So Elspeth
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>would have loved that! So the smothered God in
you loves that!"</p>

<p>"It is the God in me that will punish him!"</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it, Glenfernie?"</p>

<p>He made a wide gesture of impatience. "Cold&mdash;languid&mdash;pithless!
You, Robin, Strickland, Alison
Touris&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gilian looked at her basket of marigolds, pinks,
and pansies. "That word death.... I bring these
here, but Elspeth is with me everywhere! There is
a riddle&mdash;there is a strange, huge mistake. She
must solve it, she must make that port of all ports&mdash;and
you and I must make it.... It is a hard,
heroic, long adventure!"</p>

<p>"I speak of the pine-tree in the blast, and such
as you would give me pansies! I speak of the
eagle at the crag-top in the storm, and you offer
butterflies!"</p>

<p>"Ah, then, go and kill her lover and the man
who was your friend!"</p>

<p>Glenfernie rose from the step, in his face strong
anger and denial. He stood, seeking for words,
looking down upon the seated woman and her
flowers. She met him with parted lips and a straight,
fearless look.</p>

<p>"Will you take half the flowers, Glenfernie, and
put them for Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"No. I cannot go there now!"</p>

<p>"I thought you would not. Now I am Elspeth.
I love her. I would give her gladness&mdash;serve her.
She says, 'Let him alone! Do you not know that
his own weird will bring him into dark countries
and light countries, and where he is to go? Is your
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>own tree to be made thwart and misshapen, that
his may be reminded that there is rightness of
growth? He is a tree&mdash;he is not a stone, nor will
he become a stone. There is a law a little larger
than your fretfulness that will take care of him!
I like Glenfernie better when he is not a busybody!'"</p>

<p>Alexander stared at her in anger. "Differences
where I thought to find likeness&mdash;likenesses where
I thought to find differences! He deceived me,
fooled me, played upon me as upon a pipe; took
my own&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Gilian. "So you are going a-hunting
for more reasons than one?&mdash;Elspeth, Elspeth!
come out of it!&mdash;for Glenfernie, after all, avenges
himself!"</p>

<p>Alexander, looking like his father, spoke slowly,
with laboring breath. "Had one asked me, I should
have said that you above all might understand.
But you, too, betray!" With a sweep of his arms
abroad, a gesture abrupt and desolate, he turned.
He quitted the sunny bare space, the kirkyard and
the woman sitting with her basket of marigolds and
pansies.</p>

<p>But two nights later he came to this place alone.</p>

<p>The moon was full. It hung like a wonder lantern
above the hill and the kirk; it made the kirkyard
cloth of silver. The yews stood unreal, or with
a delicate, other reality. It was neither warm nor
cold. The moving air neither struck nor caressed,
but there breathed a sense of coming and going,
unhurried and unperplexed, from far away to far
away. The laird of Glenfernie crossed long grass
to where, for a hundred years, had been laid the
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>dead from White Farm. There was a mound bare
to the sunlight thrown from the moon. He saw
the flowers that Gilian had brought.</p>

<p>The flowers were colorless in the moonlight&mdash;and
yet they could be, and were, clothed with a hue
of anger from himself. They lay before him purple-crimson.
They were withered, but suddenly
they had sap, life, fullness&mdash;but a distasteful, reminding
life, a life in opposition! He took them
and threw them away.</p>

<p>Now the mound rested bare. He lay down beside
it. He stretched his arms over it. "Elspeth!"&mdash;and
"Elspeth!"&mdash;and "Elspeth!" But Elspeth
did not answer&mdash;only the cool sunlight thrown back
from the moon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>Ian traveled toward a pass through the Pyrenees.
Behind him stretched difficult, hazardous,
slow travel&mdash;weeks of it. Behind those weeks
lay the voyage to Lisbon, and from Lisbon in a
second boat north to Vigo. From Vigo to this day
of forested slopes and brawling streams, steadily
worsening road, ruder dwellings, more primitive,
impoverished folk, rolled a time of difficulties small
and great, like the mountain pebbles for number.
It took will and wit at strain to dissolve them all,
and so make way out of Spain into France&mdash;through
France&mdash;to Paris, where were friends.</p>

<p>Spanish travel was difficult at best&mdash;Spanish travel
with scarcely any gold to travel on found the "best"
quite winnowed out. Slow at all times, it grew,
lacking money, to be like one of those dreams
of retardation. Ian gathered and blew upon his
philosophy, and took matters at last with some
amusement, at times, even, with a sense of the
enjoyable.</p>

<p>He was not quite penniless. Those who had
helped in his escape from Edinburgh had provided
him gold. But, his voyage paid for, he must buy
at Vigo fresh apparel and a horse. When at last
he rode eastward and northward he was poor enough!
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>Food and lodging must be bought for himself and
his steed. Inns and innkeepers, chance folk applied
to for guidance, petty officials in perennially
suspicious towns&mdash;twenty people a day stood ready
to present a spectral aspect of leech and gold-sucker!
He was expert in traveling, but usually he had
borne a purse quite like that of Fortunatus. Now
he must consider that he might presently have to
sell his horse&mdash;and it was not a steed of Roland's,
to bring a great price! He might be compelled to
go afoot into France. He might be sufficiently
blessed if the millennium did not find him yet living
by his wits in Spain. It was Spanish, that prospect!
Turn what? Ian asked himself. Bull-fighter&mdash;fencing-master&mdash;gipsy&mdash;or
brigand? He played
with the notion of fencing-master. But he would
have to sell his horse to provide room and equipment,
and he must turn aside to some considerable
town. Brigand would be easier, in these wild forests
and rock fortresses that climbed and stood upon the
sky-line. Matter enough for perplexity! But the
sweep of forest and mountain wall was admirable&mdash;admirable
the air, the freedom from the Edinburgh
prison. Except occasionally, in the midst of some
intensification of annoyance, he rode and maneuvered
undetected.</p>

<p>Past happenings might and did come across him
in waves. He remembered, he regretted; he pursued
a dialectic with various convenient divisions
of himself. But all that would be lost for long
times in the general miraculous variety of things!
On the whole, going through Spain in the autumn
weather, even with poverty making mouths along<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>side,
was not a sorry business! Zest lived in pitting
vigor and wit against mole hills threatening an
aggregation into mountains! As for time, what was
it, anyhow, to matter so much? He owned time
and a wide world.</p>

<p>Delay and delay and delay. In one town the
alcalde kept him a week, denying him the road
beyond while inquiries were made as to his identity
or non-identity with some famed outlaw escaping
from justice. Further on, his horse fell badly lame
and he stayed day after day in a miserable village,
lounging under a cork-tree, learning patois. There
was a girl with great black eyes. He watched her,
two or three times spoke to her. But when she saw
how he must haggle over the price of food and
lodging she laughed, and returned to the side of a
muleteer with a sash and little bells upon his hat.</p>

<p>All along the road fell these retardations. Then
as the mountains loomed higher, the spirit of contradiction
apparently grew tired and fell behind.
For several days he traveled quite easily. "My
Lady Fortune," asked Ian, "what is up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>The air stayed smiling and sweet. In a town
half mountain, half plain, he made friends at the
inn with Don Fernando, son of an ancient, proud,
decaying house, poor as poverty. Don Fernando
had been in Paris, knew by hearsay England, and
had heard Scotland mentioned. Spaniard and Scot
drank together. The former was drawn into almost
love of Ian. Here was a help against boundless
ennui! Ian and his horse, and the small mail
strapped behind the saddle, finally went off with
Don Fernando to spend a week in his old house on
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>the hillside just without the town. Here was poverty
also, but yet sufficient acres to set a table and
pour good wine and to make the horse forget the
famine road behind him. Here were lounging and
siesta, rest for body and mind, sweet "do well a
very little!" Don Fernando would have kept the
guest a second week and then a third.</p>

<p>But Ian shook his head, laughed, embraced him,
promised a return of good when the great stream
made it possible, and set forth upon his further
travel. The horse looked sleek, almost fat. The
Scot's jaded wardrobe was cleaned, mended, refreshed.
Living with Don Fernando were an elder
sister and an ancient cousin who had fallen in love
with the big, handsome Don, traveling so oddly.
These had set hand-maidens to work, with the result
that Ian felt himself spruce as a newly opened
pink. And Don Fernando gave him a traveling-cloak&mdash;very
fine&mdash;a last year's gift, it seemed, from
a grandee he had obliged. Cold weather was approaching
and its warmth would be grateful. Ian's
great need was for money in purse. These new
friends had so little of that that he chose not to
ask for a loan. After all, he could sell the cloak!</p>

<p>The day was fine, the country mounting as it
were by stairs toward the mountains. Before him
climbed a string of pack-mules. The merchant
owning them and their lading traveled with a guard
of stout young men. For some hours Ian had the
merchant for companion and heard much of the
woes of the region and the times, the miseries of
travel, the cursed inns, bandits licensed and unlicensed,
craft, violence, and robbery! The mer<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>chant
bewailed all life and kept a hawk eye upon
his treasure on the Spanish road. At last he and
his guard, his mules and muleteers, turned aside
into a skirting way that would bring him to a town
visible at no great distance. Left alone, Ian viewed
from a hilltop the roofs of this place, with a tower
or two starting up like warning fingers. But his
road led on through a mountain pass.</p>

<p>The earth itself seemed to be climbing. The
mountain shapes, little and big, gathered in herds.
Cliffs, ravines, the hoarse song of water, the faces
of few human folk, and on these written "Mountains,
mountains! Live as we can! Catch who catch
can!" After a time the road was deprived of even
these faces. The Scot thought of home mountains.
He thought of the Highlands. Above him and at
some distance to the right appeared a distribution
of cliffs that reminded him of that hiding-place
after Culloden. He looked to see the birchwood,
the wheeling eagle. The sun was at noon. Riding
in a solitude, he almost dozed in the warm light.
The Highlands and the eagle wheeling above the
crag.... Black Hill and Glenfernie and White Farm
and Alexander.... Life generally, and all the funny
little figures running full tilt, one against another....</p>

<p>His horse sprang violently aside, then stood trembling.
Forms, some ragged, some attired with a violent
picturesqueness, had started from without a
fissure in the wood and from behind a huge wayside
rock. Ian knew them at a glance for those brigands
of whom he had heard mention and warning enough.
Don Fernando had once described their practices.</p>

<p>Resistance was idle. He chose instead a genial
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>patience for his tower, and within it keen wits to
keep watch. With his horse he was taken by the
fierce, bedizened dozen up a gorge to so complete
and secure a robber hold that Nature, when she
made it, must have been in robber mood. Here
were found yet others of the band, with a bedecked
and mustached chief. He was aware that property,
not life, answered to their desires. His horse, his
fine cloak, his weapons, the small mail and its contents,
with any article of his actual wearing they
might fancy, and the little, little, little money within
his purse&mdash;all would be taken. All in the luck!
To-day to thee, to-morrow to me. What puzzled
him was that evidently more was expected.</p>

<p>When they condescended to direct speech he
could understand their language well enough. Nor
did they indulge in over-brutal handling; they
kept a measure and reminded him sufficiently of old
England's own highwaymen. Of course, like old
England's own, they would become atrocious if they
thought that circumstances indicated it. But they
did not seem inclined to go out of their way to be
murderous or tormenting. The only sensible course
was to take things good-naturedly and as all in the
song! The worst that might happen would be that
he must proceed to France afoot, without a penny,
lacking weapons, Don Fernando's cloak&mdash;all things,
in short, but the bare clothing he stood in. To make
loss as small as possible there were in order suavity,
coolness, even gaiety!</p>

<p>And still appeared the perplexing something he
could not resolve. The over-fine cloak, the horse
now in good condition, might have something to
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>do with it, contrasting as they certainly did with
the purse in the last stages of emaciation. And
there seemed a studying of his general appearance,
of his features, even. Two men in especial appeared
detailed to do this. At last his ear caught
the word "ransom."</p>

<p>Now there was nobody in Spain knowing enough
or caring enough of or for Ian Rullock to entertain
the idea of parting with gold pieces in order to save
his life. Don Fernando might be glad to see him
live, but certainly had not the gold pieces! Moreover,
it presently leaked fantastically out that the
bandits expected a large ransom. He began to suspect
a mistake in identity. That assumption, increasing
in weight, became certainty. They looked
him all around, they compared notes, they regarded
the fine cloak, the refreshed steed. "English, se&ntilde;or,
English?"</p>

<p>"Scots. You do not understand that? Cousin
to English."</p>

<p>"English. We had word of your traveling&mdash;with
plenty of gold."</p>

<p>"It is a world of mistakes. I travel, but I have
no gold."</p>

<p>"It is a usual lack of memory of the truth. We
find it often. You are traveling with escort&mdash;with
another of your nation, your brother, we suppose.
There are servants. You are rich. For some great
freak you leave all in the town down there and ride
on alone. Foreigners often act like madmen.
Perhaps you meant to return to the town. Perhaps
to wait for them in the inn below the pass. You
have not gold in your purse because there is bounti<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>ful
gold just behind you. Why hurt the beautiful
truth? Sancho and Pedro here were in the inn-yard
last night."</p>

<p>Sancho's hoarse voice emerged from the generality.
"It was dusk, but we saw you plainly enough, we
are sure, se&ntilde;or! In your fine cloak, speaking English,
discussing with a big tall man who rode in
with you and sat down to supper with you and was
of your rank and evidently, we think, your brother
or close kinsman!"</p>

<p>The chief nodded. "It is to him that we apply
for your ransom. You, se&ntilde;or, shall write the letter,
and Sancho and Pedro shall carry it down. It
will be placed, without danger to us, in your brother's
hand. We have our ways.... Then, in turn, your
brother shall ride forth, with a single companion,
from the town, and in a clear space that we shall indicate,
put the ransom beneath a certain rock, turning
his horse at once and returning the way he came.
If the gold is put there, as much as we ask, and
according to our conditions, you shall go free as a
bird, se&ntilde;or, though perhaps with as little luggage
as a bird. If we do not receive the ransom&mdash;why,
then, the life of a bird is a little thing! We shall
put you to death."</p>

<p>Ian combated the profound mistake. What was
the use? They did not expect him to speak truth,
but they were convinced that they had the truth
themselves. At last it came, on his part, to a
titanic whimsicalness of assent. At least, assenting,
he would not die in the immediate hour! Stubbornly
refuse to do their bidding, and his thread of life
would be cut here and now.</p>

<p><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>"All events grow to seem unintelligible masks!
So why quarrel with one mask more? Pen, ink,
and paper?"</p>

<p>All were produced.</p>

<p>"I must write in English?"</p>

<p>"That is understood, se&ntilde;or. Now this&mdash;and
this&mdash;is what you are to write in English."</p>

<p>The captive made a correct guess that not more
than one or two of the captors could read Spanish,
and none at all English.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, se&ntilde;or," said the chief, "you will
know that if the gold is not put in that place and
after that fashion that I tell you, we shall let you
die, and that not easily! So we think that you will
not make English mistakes any more than Spanish
ones."</p>

<p>Ian nodded. He wrote the letter. Sancho put
it in his bosom and with Pedro disappeared from
the dark ravine. The situation relaxed.</p>

<p>"You shall eat, drink, sleep, and be entirely comfortable,
se&ntilde;or, until they return. If they bring
the gold you shall pursue your road at your pleasure
even with a piece for yourself, for we are nothing
if not generous! If they do not bring it, why, then,
of course&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Ian had long been bedfellow of wild adventure.
He thought that he knew the mood in which it was
best met. The mood represented the grist of much
subtle effort, comparing, adjustment, and readjustment.
He cultivated it now. The banditti admired
courage, coolness, and good humor. They had provision
of food and wine, the sun still shone warm.
The robber hold was set amid dark, gipsy beauty.</p>

<p><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>The sun went down, the moon came up. Ian,
lying upon shaggy skins, knew well that to-morrow
night&mdash;the night after at most&mdash;he might not see
the sun descend, the moon arise. What then?</p>

<p>Alexander Jardine, sailing from Scotland, came
to Lisbon a month after Ian Rullock. He knew the
name of the ship that had carried the fugitive, and
fortune had it that she was yet in this port, waiting
for her return lading. He found the captain,
learned that Ian had transhipped north to Vigo. He
followed. At Vigo he picked up a further trace and
began again to follow. He followed across Spain on
the long road to France. He had money, horses,
servants when he needed them, skill in travel, a tireless,
great frame, a consuming purpose. He made
mistakes in roads and rectified them; followed
false clues, then turned squarely from them and
obtained another leading. He squandered upon
the great task of dogging Ian, facing Ian, showing
Ian, again and again showing Ian, the wrong that
had been done, patience, wealth of kinds, a discovering
and prophetic imagination. He traveled until
at last here was the earth, climbing, climbing, and
before him the forested slopes, the mountain walls,
the great partition between Spain and France. An
eagle would fly over it, and another eagle would follow
him, for a nest had been robbed and a friendship
destroyed!</p>

<p>As the mountains enlarged he fell in with an Englishman
of rank, a nobleman given to the study of
literature and peoples, amateur on the way to connoisseurship,
and now traveling in Spain. He journeyed
<i>en prince</i> with his secretary and his physician,
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>servants and pack-horses, and, in addition, for at
least this part of Spain, an armed escort furnished
by the authorities, at his proper cost, against just
those banditti dangers that haunted this strip of
the globe. This noble found in the laird of Glenfernie
a chance-met gentleman worth cultivating
and detaining at his side as long as might be. They
had been together three or four days when at eve
they came to the largest inn of a town set at a short
distance from the mountain pass through which
ran their further road. Here, at dusk, they dismounted
in the inn-yard, about them a staring,
commenting crowd. Presently they went to supper
together. The Englishman meant to tarry a while
in this town to observe certain antiquities. He
might stay a week. He urged that his companion
of the last few days stay as well. But the laird of
Glenfernie could not.</p>

<p>"I have an errand, you see. I am to find something.
I must go on."</p>

<p>"Two days, then. You say yourself that your
horses need rest."</p>

<p>"They do.... I will stay two days."</p>

<p>But when morning came the secretary and the
physician alone appeared at table. The nobleman
lay abed with a touch of fever. The physician reported
that the trouble was slight&mdash;fatigue and a
chill taken. A couple of days' repose and his lordship
would be himself again.</p>

<p>Glenfernie walked through the town. Returning
to the inn, he found that the Englishman had
asked for him. For an hour or two he talked or
listened, sitting by the nobleman's bed. Leaving
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>him at last, he went below to the inn's great room,
half open to the courtyard and all the come and go
of the place. It was late afternoon. He sat by a
table placed before the window, and the river
seemed to flow by him, and now he looked at it
from a rocky island, and now he looked elsewhere.
The room grew ruddy from the setting sun. An
inn servant entered and busied himself about the
place. After him came an aged woman, half gipsy,
it seemed. She approached the seat by the window.
Her worn mantle, her wide sleeve, seemed to touch
the deep stone sill. She was gone like a moth.
Glenfernie's eye discovered a folded paper lying in
the window. It had not been there five minutes
earlier. Now it lay before him like a sudden outgrowth
from the stone. He put out a hand and
took it up. The woman was gone, the serving-man
was gone. Outside flowed the river. Alexander unfolded
the paper. It was addressed to <i>Se&ntilde;or Nobody</i>.
It lay upon his knee, and it was Ian's hand. His
lips moved, his vision blurred. Then came steadiness
and he read.</p>

<p>What he read was a statement, at once tense
and whimsical, of the predicament of the writer.
The latter, recognizing the confusion of thought
among his captors, wrote because he must, but did
not truly expect any aid from Se&ntilde;or Nobody. The
writing would, however, prolong life for two days,
perhaps for three. If at the end of that time ransom
were not forthcoming death would forthcome.
Release would follow ransom. But Se&ntilde;or Nobody
truly could not be expected to take interest! Most
conceivably the stranger's lot must remain the
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>stranger's lot. In that case pardon for the annoyance!
If, miraculously, the bearer did find
Se&ntilde;or Nobody&mdash;if Se&ntilde;or Nobody read this letter&mdash;if
strangers were not strangers to Se&ntilde;or Nobody&mdash;if
gold and mercy lay alike in Se&ntilde;or Nobody's keeping&mdash;then
so and so must be done. Followed three or
four lines of explicit directions. Did all the above
come about, then truly would the undersigned, living,
and pursuing his journey into France, and
making return to Se&ntilde;or Nobody when he might,
rest the latter's slave! Followed the signature,
<i>Ian Rullock</i>.</p>

<p>Alexander sat by the window, in the rocky island,
and the Spanish river flowed by. It was dusk.
Then came lights, and the English secretary and
physician, with servants to lay the table and bring
supper. Glenfernie ate and drank with the two
men. His lordship was reported better, would
doubtless be up to-morrow. The talk fell upon
Greece, to which country the nobleman was, in the
end, bound. Greek art, Greek literature, Greek
myth. Here the secretary proved scholar and enthusiast,
a liker especially of the byways of myth.
He and Alexander voyaged here and there among
them. "And you remember, too," said the secretary,
"the Cranes of Ibycus&mdash;"</p>

<p>They rose at last from table. Secretary and
physician must return to their patron. "I am
going to hunt bed and sleep," said Glenfernie.
"To-morrow, if his lordship is recovered, we'll go
see that church."</p>

<p>In the rude, small bedchamber he found his Spanish
servant. Presently he would dismiss him, but
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>first, "Tell me, Gil, of the banditti in these mountains."</p>

<p>Gil told. The foreigner who employed him asked
questions, referred intelligently from answer to
answer, and at last had in hand a compact body of
information. He bade Gil good night. Ways of
banditti in any age or place were much the same!</p>

<p>The room was small, with a rude and narrow bed.
There was a window, small, too, but open to the
night. Pouring through this there entered a vagrant
procession of sound, with, in the interstices, a silence
that had its own voice. As the night deepened the
procession thinned, at last died away.</p>

<p>When he undressed he had taken the letter to
Se&ntilde;or Nobody and put it upon the table. Now,
lying still and straight upon the bed in the dark
room, there seemed a blacker darkness where it lay,
four feet from him, a little above the level of his
eyes. There it was, a square, a cube, of Egyptian
night, hard, fierce, black, impenetrable.</p>

<p>For a long time he kept a fixed gaze upon it. Beyond
and above it glimmered the window. The
larger square at last drew his eyes. He lay another
long while, very still, with the window before him.
Lying so, thought at last grew quiet, hushed, subdued.
Very quietly, very sweetly, like one long
gone, loved in the past, returning home, there
slipped into view, borne upon the stream of consciousness,
an old mood of stillness, repose, dawn-light
by which the underneath of things was seen.
Once it had come not infrequently, then blackness
and hardness had whelmed it and it came no more.
He had almost forgotten the feel of it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>Presently it would go.... It did so, finding at this
time a climate in which it could not long live. But
it was powerfully a modifier.... Glenfernie, dropping
his eyes from the window, found the square that
was the letter, a square of iron gray.</p>

<p>A part of the night he lay still upon the narrow
bed, a part he spent in slow walking up and down the
narrow room, a part he stood motionless by the
window. The dawn was faintly in the sky when
at last he took from beneath the pillow his purse
and a belt filled with gold pieces and sat down to
count them over and compare the total with the
figures upon a piece of paper. This done, he dressed,
the light now gray around him. The letter to Se&ntilde;or
Nobody lay yet upon the table. At last, dressed,
he took it up and put it in the purse with the gold.
Leaving the room, he waked his servant where he
lay and gave him directions. A faint yellow light
gleamed in the lowest east.</p>

<p>He waited an hour, then went to the room where
slept the secretary and the physician. They were
both up and dressing. The physician had been to
his patron's room. "Yes, his lordship was better&mdash;was
awake&mdash;meant after a while to rise." Glenfernie
would send in a request. Something had occurred
which made him very desirous to see his
lordship. If he might have a few minutes&mdash;?
The secretary agreed to make the inquiry, went and
returned with the desired invitation. Glenfernie
followed him to the nobleman's chamber and was
greeted with geniality. Seated by the Englishman's
bed, he made his explanation and request. He had
so much gold with him&mdash;he showed the contents
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>of the belt and purse&mdash;and he had funds with an
agent in Paris and again funds in Amsterdam.
Here were letters of indication. With a total unexpectedness
there had come to him in this town
a call that he could not ignore. He could not explain
the nature of it, but a man of honor would feel
it imperative. But it would take nicely all his gold
and so many pieces besides. He asked the loan of
these, together with an additional amount sufficient
to bring him through to Paris. Once there he could
make repayment. In the mean time his personal
note and word&mdash;The Englishman made no trouble
at all.</p>

<p>"I'll take your countenance and bearing, Mr.
Jardine. But I'll make condition that we do travel
together, after all, as far, at least, as Tours, where
I mean to stop awhile."</p>

<p>"I agree to that," said Glenfernie.</p>

<p>The secretary counted out for him the needed
gold. In the narrow room in which he had slept
he put this with his own in a bag. He put with it
no writing. There was nothing but the bare gold.
Carrying it with him, he went out to find the horses
saddled and waiting. With Gil behind him, he went
from the inn and out of the town. The letter to
Se&ntilde;or Nobody had given explicit enough direction.
Clear of all buildings, he drew rein and took bearings.
Here was the stream, the stump of a burned mill,
the mountain-going road, narrower and rougher
than the way of main travel. He followed this
road; the horses fell into a plodding deliberateness
of pace. The sunshine streamed warm around, but
there was little human life here to feel its rays.
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>After a time there came emergence into a bare,
houseless, almost treeless plain or plateau. The
narrow, little-traveled road went on upon the edge
of this, but a bridle-path led into and across the
bareness. Alexander followed it. Before him,
across the waste, sprang cliffs with forest at their
feet. But the waste was wide, and in the sun
they showed like nothing more than a burnished,
distant wall. His path would turn before he reached
them. The plain's name might have been Solitariness.
It lay naked of anything more than small
scattered stones and bushes. There upgrew before
him the tree to which he was bound. A solitary,
twisted oak it shot out of the plain, its protruding
roots holding stones in their grasp. Around was
shelterless and bare, but the heightening wall of cliff
seemed to be watching. Alexander rode nearer,
dismounted, left Gil with the two horses, and, the
bag of gold in his hand, walked to the tree. Here
was the stone shaped like a closed hand. He put
the ransom between the stone fingers and the stone
palm. There was no word with it. Se&ntilde;or Nobody
had no name. He turned and strode back to the
horses, mounted, and with Gil rode from the naked,
sunny plain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle lay a year in the
future. Yet in Paris, under certain conditions
and auspices, Scot or Englishman might dwell in
security enough. The Jacobite remnant, foe to the
British government, found France its best harbor.
A quietly moving Scots laird, not Jacobite, yet
might be lumped by the generality with those forfeited
Scots gentlemen who, having lost all in a
cause urged and supported by France, now, without
scruple, took from King Louis a pension that put
food in their mouths, coats on their backs, roofs
over their heads. Alexander Jardine, knowing the
city, finding quiet lodgings in a quiet street, established
himself in Paris. It was winter now, cold,
bright weather.</p>

<p>In old days he had possessed not a few acquaintances
in this city. A circle of thinkers,
writers, painters, had powerfully attracted him.
Circumstances brought him now again into relation
with one or two of this group. He did not seek
them as formerly he had done. But neither could
he be said to avoid companionship when it came
his way. It was not his wish to become singular
or solitary. But he was much alone, and while he
waited for Ian he wandered in the rich Paris of old,
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>packed life. Street and Seine-side and market knew
him; he stood in churches, and before old altarpieces
smoked by candles. Booksellers remarked
him. Where he might he heard music; sometimes
he would go to the play. He carried books to his
lodging. He sat late at night over volumes new
and old. The lamp burned dim, the fire sank;
he put aside reading and knowledge gained through
reading, and sat, sunk deep into a dim desert within
himself; at last got to bed and fell to sleep and to
dreams that fatigued, that took him nowhere.
When the next day was here he wandered again
through the streets.</p>

<p>One of his old acquaintances he saw oftener than
he did others. This was a scholar, a writer, an
encyclopedist of to-morrow who liked the big Scot
and to be in his company. One day, chance met,
they leaned together upon the parapet of a bridge,
and watched the crossing throng. "One's own
particles in transit! Can you grasp that, Deschamps?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it advanced. No. It is hard to
hold."</p>

<p>"It is like a mighty serpent. You would think
you had it and then it is gone.... If one could hold
it it would transform the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would. At what are you staring?"</p>

<p>"The serpent is gone. I thought that I saw one
whom I do not hold to be art and part with me."
He gazed after a crossing horseman. "No! There
was merely a trick of him. It is some other."</p>

<p>"The man for whom you are waiting?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>Deschamps returned to the subject of a moment
before. "It is likely that language bewrays much
more than we think it does. I say 'the man.'
You echo it. And I am 'man.' And you are 'man.'
'Man'&mdash;'Man'! Every instant it is said. Yet the
identity that we state we never assume!"</p>

<p>"I said that we could not hold the serpent."</p>

<p>Ten days afterward he did see Ian. The latter,
after a slow and difficult progress through France,
came afoot into Paris. He sought, and was glad
enough to find, an old acquaintance and sometime
fellow-conspirator&mdash;Warburton.</p>

<p>"Blessed friendship!" he said, and warmed himself
by Warburton's fire. Something within him
winced, and would, if it could, have put forward a
different phrase.</p>

<p>Warburton poured wine for him. "Now tell your
tale! For months those of us who remained in
Paris have heard nothing but Trojan woes!"</p>

<p>Ian told. Culloden and after&mdash;Edinburgh&mdash;Lisbon&mdash;Vigo&mdash;travel
in Spain&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Nobody&mdash;</p>

<p>"That was a curious adventure! And you don't
know the ransomer's name?"</p>

<p>"Not I! Se&ntilde;or Nobody he rests."</p>

<p>"Well, and after that?"</p>

<p>Ian related his wanderings from the Pyrenees up
to Paris. Scotland, Spain, and France, the artist in
him painted pictures for Warburton&mdash;painted with
old ableness and abandon, and, Warburton thought,
with a new subtlety. The friend hugged his knees
and enjoyed it like a well-done play. Here was
Rullock's ancient spirit, grown more richly appealing!
Trouble at least had not downed him. Warburton,
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>who in the past year had been thrown in contact
with a number whom it had downed, and who had
suffered depression thereby, felt gratitude to Ian
Rullock for being larger, not smaller, than usual.</p>

<p>At last, the fire still burning, Ian warmed and refreshed,
they wheeled from retrospect into the present.
Warburton revealed how thoroughly shattered
were Stewart hopes.</p>

<p>"I begin to see, Rullock, that we've simply passed
those things by. We can't go back to that state
of mind and affairs."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back."</p>

<p>"I like to hear you say that. I hear so much
whining the other way! Well, as a movement it's
over.... And the dead are dead, and the scarred
and impoverished will have to pick themselves up."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Is there any immediate helping hand?"</p>

<p>"King Louis gives a pension. It's not much, but
it keeps one from starving. And as for you, I've in
keeping a packet for you from England. It reached
me through Goodworth, the India merchant. I've
a notion that your family will manage to put in
your hand some annual amount. Of course your
own fortune is sequestered and you can return
neither to England nor to Scotland."</p>

<p>"My aunt may have had faith that I was living.
She would do all that she could to help.... No, I'll
not go back."</p>

<p>"Your chance would lie in some post here. Take
up old acquaintances where they have power, and
recommend yourself to new ones with power.
Great ladies in especial," said Warburton.</p>

<p>"We haven't passed that by?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>"Not yet, Rullock, not yet!"</p>

<p>Ian dreamed over the fire. At last he stretched
his arms. "Let us go sleep, Warburton! I have
come miles...."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is late. Oh, one thing more! Alexander
Jardine is in Paris."</p>

<p>"Alexander!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what he is doing here. In with
the writing, studying crew, I suppose. I came
upon him by accident, near the Sorbonne. He did
not see me and I did not speak."</p>

<p>"I'll not avoid him!"</p>

<p>"I remember your telling me that you had quarreled.
That was the eve of your leaving Paris in
the springtime, before the Prince went to Scotland.
You haven't made it up?"</p>

<p>"No. I suppose we'll never make it up."</p>

<p>"What was it over?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that.... It had a double thread.
Did he come to Paris, I wonder, because he guessed
that I would bring up here?" He rose and stood
staring down into the fire. "I think that he did
so. Well, if he means to follow me through the
world, let him follow! And now no more to-night,
Warburton! I want sleep&mdash;sleep&mdash;sleep!"</p>

<p>The next day and the next and the next began
a new French life. He had luck, or he had the
large momentum of a personality not negligible, an
orb covered with a fine network of enchanter's
symbols. The packet from England held money,
with an engagement to forward a like sum twice
a year. It was not a great sum, but such as it was
he did not in the least scorn it. It had come, after
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>all, from Archibald Touris&mdash;but Ian knew the influence
behind that.</p>

<p>Warburton presented his name to the Minister
who dispensed King Louis's fund for Scots gentlemen
concerned in the late attempt, losers of all, and
now destitute in France. So much would come out
of that! The two together waited upon monseigneur
in whose coach they had once crossed the Seine.
He had blood ties with Stewart kings of yesterday,
and in addition to that evidenced a queer, romantic
fondness for lost causes, and a willingness to ferry
across rivers those who had been engaged in them.
Now he displayed toward the Englishman and the
Scot a kind of eery, distant graciousness. Ah yes!
he would speak here and there of Monsieur Ian
Rullock&mdash;he would speak to the King. If there
were things going <i>ces messieurs</i> might as well have
some good of them! Out of old acquaintances in
Paris Ian gathered not a few who were in position
to further new fortunes. Some of these were men
and some were women. He took a lodging, neither
so good nor so bad. Warburton found him a servant.
He obtained fine clothes, necessary working-garb
where one pushed one's fortune among fine
folk. The more uncertain and hazardous looked his
fortunes the more he walked and spoke as though
he were a golden favorite of the woman with the
wheel.</p>

<p>All this moved rapidly. He had not been in Paris
a week ere again, as many times before, he had the
stage all set for Success to walk forth upon it! But
it had come December&mdash;December&mdash;December, and
he looked forward to that month's passing.</p>

<p><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>He had not seen Alexander. Then, in the middle
of the month he found himself one evening in a
peacock cluster of fine folk, at the theater&mdash;a famous
actress to be viewed in a comedy grown the rage.
The play was nearly over when he saw Alexander
in the pit, turned from the stage, gazing steadily
upon him. Ian placed himself where he might
still see him, and returned the gaze.</p>

<p>Going out when the play was over, the two met
face to face in the lighted space between the doors.
Each was in company of others&mdash;Ian with a courtier,
decked and somewhat loudly laughing group, Glenfernie
with a painter of landscape, Deschamps, and
an Oriental, member of some mission to the West.
Meeting so, they stopped short. Their nostrils
dilated, there seemed to come a stirring over their
bodies. Inwardly they felt a painful constriction,
a contraction to something hard, intent, and fanged.
This was the more strongly felt by Alexander, but
Ian felt it, too. Did Glenfernie mean to dog him
through life&mdash;think that he would be let to do so?
Alone in a forest, very far back, they might, at this
point, have flown at each other's throat. But they
had felled many forests since the day when just
that was possible.... The thing conventionally in
order for such a moment as the present was to act
as though that annihilation which each wished upon
the other had been achieved. All that they had
shared since the day when first they met, boys on a
heath in Scotland, should be instantaneously blotted
out. Two strangers, jostled face to face in a playhouse,
should turn without sign that there had
ever been that heath. So, symbolically, annihila<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>tion
might be secured! For a moment each sought
for the blank eyes, the unmoved stone face.</p>

<p>As from a compartment above sifted down a dry
light with great power of lighting. It came into
Alexander's mind, into that, too, of Ian.... How
absurd was the human animal! All this saying the
opposite left the truth intact. They were not
strangers, each was quite securely seated in the
other. Self-annihilation&mdash;self-oblivion!... All
these farcical high horses!... Men went to see
comedies and did not see their own comedy.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie and Ian Rullock each very
slightly and coldly acknowledged the other's presence.
No words passed. But the slow amenity of
life bent by a fraction the head of each, just parted
the lips of each. Then Alexander turned with an
abrupt movement of his great body and with his
companions was swallowed by the crowd.</p>

<p>On his bed that night, lying straight with his
hands upon his breast, he had for the space of one
deep breath an overmastering sense of the suaveness
of reality. Crudity, angularity, harshness,
seemed to vanish, to dissolve. He knew dry beds
of ancient torrents that were a long and somewhat
wide wilderness of mere broken rock, stone piece
by stone piece, and only the more jagged edges lost
and only the surface worn by the action, through
ages, of water. It was as though such a bed grew
beneath his eyes meadow smooth&mdash;smoother than
that&mdash;smooth as air, air that lost nothing by yielding&mdash;smooth
as ether that, yielding all, yielded
nothing.... The moment went, but left its memory.
As the moment was large so was its memory.</p>

<p><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>He fought against it with tribes of memories,
lower and dwarfish, but myriads strong. The bells
from some convent rang, the December stars blazed
beyond his window, he put out his arms to the
December cold.</p>

<p>Ian, despite that moment in the playhouse, looked
for the arrival of a second challenge from Glenfernie.
For an instant it might be that they had seen that
things couldn't be so separate, after all! That there
was, as it were, some universal cement. But instants
passed, and, indubitably, the world was a
broken field! Enmity still existed, full-veined. It
would be like this Alexander, who had overshot
another Alexander, to send challenge after challenge,
never to rest satisfied with one crossing of weapons,
with blood drawn once! Or if there was no challenge,
no formal duel, still there would be duel.
He would pursue&mdash;he would cry, "Turn!"&mdash;there
would be perpetuity of encounter. To the world's
end there was to be the face of menace, of old reproach&mdash;the
arrows dropped of pain of many sorts.
"In short, vengeance," said Ian. "Vengeance deep
as China! When he used to deny himself revenge
in small things it was all piling up for this!... What
I did slipped the leash for him! Well, aren't we
evened?"</p>

<p>What he looked for came, brought by Deschamps.
The two met in a field outside Paris, with seconds,
with all the conventionally correct paraphernalia.
The setting differed from that of their lonely fight
on a Highland mountain-side. But again Ian, still
the better swordsman, wounded Alexander. This
time he gave&mdash;willed perhaps to give&mdash;a slight hurt.</p>

<p><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>"That is nothing!" said Glenfernie. "Continue&mdash;"
But the seconds, coming between them, would not
have it so. It was understood that their principals
had met before, and upon the same count. Blood
had been drawn. It was France&mdash;and mere ugly
tooth-and-claw business not in favor. Blood had
flowed&mdash;now part!</p>

<p>"'Must' drives then to-day," said Alexander.
"But it is December still, Ian Rullock!"</p>

<p>"Turn the world so, if you will, Glenfernie!"
answered the other. "And yet there is June somewhere!"</p>

<p>They left the field. Alexander, going home in a
hired coach with Deschamps, sat in silence, looking
out of the window. His arm was bandaged and
held in a sling.</p>

<p>"They breed determined foes in Scotland," said
Deschamps.</p>

<p>"That Scotland is in me," Glenfernie answered.
"That Scotland and that December."</p>

<p>Three days later he wandered alone in Paris,
came at last to old stone steps leading down to the
river, in an unpopulous quarter. A few boats lay
fastened to piles, but the landing-place hung deserted
in the winter sunlight. There lacked not a
week of Christmas. But the season had been mild.
To-day was not cold, and stiller than still. Glenfernie,
his cloak about him, sat upon the river steps
and watched the stream. It went by, and still it
stood there before him. It came from afar, and it
went to afar, and still it shone where his hand
might touch it. It turned like a wheel, from the
gulf to the height and around again. He followed
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>its round&mdash;ocean and climbing vapor, cloud, rain,
and far mountain springs, descent and the mother
sea. The mind, expanding, ceased to examine
radius by radius, but held the whole wheel. Alexander
sat in inner quiet, forgetting December.</p>

<p>Turning from that contemplation, he yet remained
still, looking now at the sunshine on the
steps.... There seemed to reach him, within and
from within, rays of color and fragrance, the soul of
spice pinks, marigolds, and pansies.... Then,
within and from within, Elspeth was with him.</p>

<p>Dead! She was not dead.... Of all idle words&mdash;!</p>

<p>It was not as a shade&mdash;it was not as a memory,
or not as the poor things that were called memory!
But she came in the authority and integrity of herself,
that was also, most dearly, most marvelously,
himself as well&mdash;permeative, penetrative, real, a
subtle breath named Elspeth! So subtle, so wide
and deep, elastic, universal, with no horizons that
he could see.... To and fro played the tides of
knowledge.</p>

<p>Elspeth all along&mdash;sunshines and shadows&mdash;Elspeth
a wide, living life&mdash;not crushed into the two
moments upon which he had brooded&mdash;not the
momentary Elspeth who had walked the glen with
him, not the momentary Elspeth lifted from the
Kelpie's Pool, borne in his arms, cold, rigid, drowned,
a long, long way! But Elspeth, integral, vibrant,
living&mdash;Elspeth of centillions of moments&mdash;Elspeth
a beautiful power moving strongly in abundant
space....</p>

<p>His form stayed moveless upon the river steps
while the wave of realization played.</p>

<p><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>The experience linked itself with that of the
other night when the stony bed of existence, broken,
harsh, irregular, had suddenly dissolved into connections
myriad wide, deep, and fine.... He had
prated with philosophers of oneness. Then what
he had prated of had been true! There was a great
difference between talking of and touching truth....</p>

<p>But he could not hold the touch. The wings
flagged, he fell into the jungle of words. His body
turned upon the steps. The caves and dens of his
being began to echo with cries and counter-cries.</p>

<p>Hurt? Had she not been hurt at all? But she
<i>was</i> hurt&mdash;poisoned, ruined, drawn to death! Had
she long and wide and living power to heal her own
harm? Still was it not there&mdash;he would have it
there!</p>

<p>Ian Rullock! With a long, inward, violent recoil
Alexander shrank into the old caves of himself. All,
the magic web of color and fragrance dwindled,
came to be a willow basket filled with White Farm
flowers placed upon the kirkyard steps.</p>

<p>Ian Rullock had stolen her&mdash;Ian, not Alexander,
had been her lover, kissed her, clasped her, there in
the glen! Ian, the Judas of friendship&mdash;thief of a
comrade's bliss&mdash;cheat, murderer, mocker, and injurer!</p>

<p>The wave of oneness fled.</p>

<p>Glenfernie, looking like the old laird his father,
his cloak wrapped around him, feeling the December
air, left the river steps, wandered away through
Paris.</p>

<p>But when he was alone with the night he tried to
recover the wave. It had been so wonderful. Even
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>the faint, faint echo, the ghostly afterglow, were exquisite;
were worth more than anything he yet had
owned. He tried to recover the earlier part of the
wave, separating it from the later flood that had
seemed critical of righteous wrath, just punishment.
But it would not come back on those terms....
But yet he wanted it, wanted it, longed for it even
while he warred against it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>That was one December. The year made twelve
steps and here was December again. With it
came to Ian a proffer from the nobleman of the
coach across the Seine. Some ancient business,
whether of soul or sense, carried him to Rome.
Monsieur Ian Rullock&mdash;said to be for the moment
banished from a certain paradise&mdash;might find it in
his interest to come with him&mdash;say as traveling
companion. Ian found it so. Monseigneur was
starting at once. Good! let us start.</p>

<p>Ian despatched his servant to the lodging known
to be occupied by the laird of Glenfernie. The man
had a note to deliver. Alexander took it and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Glenfernie</span>,&mdash;I am quitting Paris with the Duc de &mdash;&mdash;,
for Rome.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ian Rullock</span>.</p></div>

<p>The man gone, Alexander put fire to the missive
and burned it, after which he walked up and down,
up and down the wide, bare room. When some
time had passed he came back to chair and table,
inkwell and pen, and a half-written letter. The
quill drove on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... None could do better by the estate than you&mdash;not I nor
any other. So I beg of you to stay, dear Strickland, who have
stayed by us so long!</p></div>

<p><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>There followed a page of business detail&mdash;inquiries&mdash;expressed
wishes. Glenfernie paused. Before him,
propped against a volume of old lore, stood a small
picture;&mdash;Orestes asleep in the grove of the Furies.
He sat leaning back in his chair, regarding it. He
had found it and purchased it months before, and
still he studied it. His eyes fell to the page; he
wrote on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You ask no questions, and yet I know that you question.
Well, I will tell you&mdash;knowing that you will strain out and give
to others only what should be given.... He has been, and I
have been, in Paris a year. He and I have fought three times&mdash;fought,
that is, as men call fighting. Once upon that mountain-side
at home, twice here. Now he is going&mdash;and I am
going&mdash;to Rome. Shall I fight him again&mdash;with metal digged
from the earth, fashioned and sharpened in some red-lighted
shop of the earth? I am not sure that I shall&mdash;rather, I think
that I shall not.... Is there ever a place where a kind of growth
does not go on? There is a moonrise in me that tells me that
that fighting is to be scorned. But what shall I do, seeing that he
is my foe?... Ah, I do not know&mdash;save haunt him, save bring
and bring again my inner man, to clinch and wrestle with and
throw, if may be, his inner man. And to see that he knows
that I do this&mdash;that it tells back upon him&mdash;through and
through tells back!... It has been a strange year. Now and
then I am aware of curious far tides, effects from some giant
orb of being. But I go on.... For my daily life in Paris&mdash;here
it is, your open page!... You see, I still seek knowledge, for all
your gibe that I sought darkness. And now, as I go to Rome&mdash;</p></div>

<p>He wrote on, changing now to details as to communication,
placing of moneys, and such matters.
At length came references to the last home news,
expressions of trust and affection. He signed his
name, folded, superscribed and sealed the letter,
then sat on, studying the picture before him.</p>

<p><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>Monseigneur, with gold, with fine horses, with an
eery, swooping, steadiness of direction, journeyed fast.
He and his traveling companion reached Rome early
in February. There was a villa, there were attendants,
there was the Frenchman's especial circle,
set with bizarre jewels, princes of the Church,
Italian nobles of his acquaintance, exiles, a charlatan
of immense note, certain ladies. He only asked of
his guest, Monsieur Rullock, that he help him to
entertain the whole chaplet, giving to his residence
in Rome a certain splendid virility.</p>

<p>February showed skies like sapphire. There
drew on carnival week. Masks and a wildness of
riot&mdash;childish, too&mdash;</p>

<p>Ian leaned against the broken base of an ancient
statue, set in the villa garden, at a point that gave
a famous view. Around, the almond-trees were in
bloom. The marble Diana had gazed hence for so
many years, had seen so much that might make the
dewy greenwood forgotten! It was mid-afternoon
and flooding light. Here Rome basked, half-asleep
in a dream of sense; here the ant city worked and
worked.</p>

<p>Ian stood between tides, behind him a forenoon,
before him an evening of carnival participation.
In the morning he had been with a stream of persons;
presently, with the declining sun, would be
with another. Here was an hour or two of pause,
time of day for rest with half-closed eyes. He looked
over the pale rose wave of the almonds, he saw
Peter's dome and St. Angelo. He was conscious of
a fatigue of his powers, a melancholy that they gave
him no more than they did. "How it is all tinsel
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>and falsetto!... I want a clean, cold, searching wave&mdash;desert
and night&mdash;not life all choked with wax
tapers and harlequins! I want something.... I
don't know what I want. I only know I haven't
got it!"</p>

<p>His arm moved upon the base of the statue. He
looked up at the white form with the arrow in its
hands. "Self-containment.... What, goddess,
you would call chastity all around?... All the
spilled self somehow centered. But just that is
difficult&mdash;difficult&mdash;more difficult than anything
Hercules attempted. Oh me!" He sat down beneath
the cypress that stood behind the statue
and rested his head within his hands. From Rome,
on all sides, broke into the still light trumpets and
bell-ringing, pipes and drums, shout and singing.
It sounded like a thousand giant cicad&aelig;. A group
of masks went through the garden, by the Diana
figure. They threw pine cones and confetti at the
gold-brown foreigner seated there. One wore an
ass's head, another was dressed as a demon with
horns and tail, a third rolled as Bacchus, a fourth,
fifth, and sixth were his m&aelig;nads. All went wildly
by, the clamor of the city swelled.</p>

<p>This was first day of carnival. Succeeding days,
succeeding nights, mounted each a stage to heights
of folly. Starred all through was innocent merrymaking,
license held in leash. But the gross, the
whirling, and the sinister elements came continuously
and more strongly into play. Measured sound
grew racket, camaraderie turned into impudence.
Came at last pandemonium. All without Rome&mdash;Campagna
and mountains&mdash;were in Rome. Peasant
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>men and women slept, when they slept, in and beneath
carts and huge wine-wagons camped and
parked in stone forests of imperial ruins. Artisan,
mechanic, and merchant Rome lightened toil and
went upon the hunt for pleasure, dropping servility
in the first ditch. Foreigners, artists, men
from everywhere, roved, gazed, and listened, shared.
The great made displays, some with beauty, some of
a perverted and monstrous taste. The lords of the
Church nodded, looked sleepily or alertly benevolent.
At times all alike turned mere populace.
Courtesans thronged, the robber and the assassin
found their prey. All men and women who might
entertain, ever so coarsely, ever so poorly, were
here at market. Mummers and players, musicians,
dancers, jugglers, gipsies, and fortune-tellers
floated thick as May-flies. Voices, voices, and every
musical instrument&mdash;but all set in a certain range,
and that not the deep nor the sweet. So it seemed,
and yet, doubtless, by searching might have been
found the deep and the sweet. Certainly the air of
heaven was sweet, and it went in and between.</p>

<p>All who might or who chose went masked. So
few did not choose that street and piazza seemed
filled with all orders of being and moments of time.
Terrible, grotesque, fantastic, pleasing, went the
rout, and now the hugest crowd was here and now
it was there, and now there were moments of even
diffusion. At night the lights were in multitude,
and in multitude the flaring and strange decorations.
Day and night swung processions, stood spectacles,
huge symbolic movements and attitudes, grown obscure
and molded to the letter, now mere stage
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>effects. Day by day through carnival week the
noise increased, restraint lessened.</p>

<p>At times Ian was in company with monseigneur
and those who came to the villa; at times he sought
or was sought by others that he knew in Rome,
fared into carnival with them. Much more rarely
he dipped into the swirl alone.</p>

<p>The saturnalia drew toward its close. Ash
Wednesday, like a great gray-sailed ship, was seen
coming large into port. The noise grew wild, license
general. All available oil must be poured into the
fire of the last day of pleasures. Ian was to have
been with monseigneur's party gathered to view a
pageant lit by torches of wax, then to drink wine,
then, in choice masks, to break in upon a dance of
nymphs, whirl away with black or brown eyes....
It was the program, but at the last he evaded
it, slipped from the villa, chose solitary going.
Why, he did not know, save that he felt aching
satiety.</p>

<p>Here in the streets were half-lights, afterglow from
the sunken sun and smoky torches. The latter increased
in number, the oil-lamps, great and small,
were lit, the tapers of various qualities and thicknesses.
Where there were open spaces vast heaps
of seasoned wood now flaming caused processions of
light and shadow among ruins, against old triumphal
arches, against churches and dwellings old, half-old,
and new, lived in, chanted in still, intact and
usable. Above was star-sown night, but Rome lay
under a kobold roof of her own lighting. Noise held
grating sway, mere restless motion enthroned with
her. Worlds of drunken grasshoppers in endless
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>scorched plains! The masks seemed now demoniac,
less beauty than ugliness.</p>

<p>Ian found himself on the Quirinal, in the great
ragged space dominated by the Colossi. Here
burned a bonfire huge enough to make Plutonian
day, and here upon the fringes of that light he encountered
a carnival brawl, and became presently
involved in it. He wore a domino striped black and
silver, and a small black mask, a black hat with
wide brim and a long, curling silver feather. He
was tall, broad-shouldered, noticeable.... The quarrel
had started among unmasked peasants, then had
swooped in a numerous band dressed as ravens.
Light-fingered gentry, inconspicuously clad, aided in
provoking misunderstanding that should shake for
them the orchard trees. A company of wine-bibbers
with monstrous, leering masks, staggering from a
side-street, fell into the whirlpool. With vociferation
and blows the whole pulled here and there, the
original cause of the falling out buried now in a host
of new causes. Ian, caught in an eddy, turned to
make way out of it. A peasant woman, there with
a group from some rock village, received a chance
buffet, so heavy that she cried out, staggered, then,
pushed against in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, fell upon the earth.
The raven crew threatened trampling. "<i>Jes&ugrave;
Maria!</i>" she cried, and tried to raise herself, but
could not. Ian, very near her, took a step farther
in and, stooping, lifted her. But now the ravens
chose to fall foul of him. The woman was presently
gone, and her peasant fellows.... He was beating
off a drunken Comus crew, with some of active ill-will.
His dress was rich&mdash;he was not Roman, evi<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>dently&mdash;the
surge had foamed and dragged across
from the bonfire and the open place to the dark
mouth of a poor street. Many a thing besides light-hearted
gaieties happened in carnival season.</p>

<p>He became aware that a friendly person had come
up, was with him beating off raven, gorgon, and
satyr. He saw that this person was very big, and
caught an old, oft-noted trick in the swing of his
arm. To-night, in carnival time, when there was
trouble, it seemed quite natural and with a touch
of home that Old Steadfast should loom forth.</p>

<p>A clang of music, shouting, and an oncoming array
of lights helped to daunt band of ravens and drunken
masks. A procession of fishermen with nets and
monsters of the sea approached, went by. The
attackers merged in the throng that attended or
followed, went away with innocent shouts and songs.
A second push followed the first, a great crowd of
masks and spectators bound for a piazza through
which was to pass one of the final large pageants.
This wave carried with it Ian and Alexander. On such
a night, where every sea was tumult, one indication,
one propelling touch, was as good as another. The two
went on in company. Alexander was not masked.
Ian was, but that did not to-night hide him from
the other. They came into the flaringly lighted
place. Around stood old ruins, piers, broken arches
and columns, and among these modern houses. For
the better viewing of the spectacle banks of seats
had been built, tier upon tier rising high, propped
against what had been ancient bath or temple.
The crowd surged to these, filling every stretch and
cranny not yet seized upon. There issued that the
<a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>tiers were packed; dark, curving, mounting rows
where foot touched shoulder. The piazza turned
amphitheater.</p>

<p>Still, in this carnival night, Ian and Alexander
found themselves together. They were sitting side
by side, a third of the way between pavement and
the topmost row. They sat still, broodingly, in a
cloud of things rememberable, no distinct images,
but all their common past, good and bad, and the
progress from one to the other, making as it were
one chord, or a mist of one color. They did not
reason about this momentary oneness, but took it
as it came. It was carnival season.</p>

<p>Yet the cloud dripped honey, the color was clear
and not unrestful, the chord sweet and resounding.</p>

<p>The pageant, fantastic, towering, red and purple
lighted, passed by. The throng upon the seats
moved, rose, struck heavily with their feet, going
down the narrow ways. Many torches had been
extinguished, many that were carried had gone on,
following the last triumphal car. Here were semi-darkness,
great noise and confusion&mdash;weight, too,
pressing upon ground that long ago had been honeycombed;
where the crypt of a three-hundred-year-old
church touched through an archway old priest
paths beneath a vanished temple, that in turn
gave into a mixed ruin of dungeons and cellars
opening at last to day or night upon a hillside at
some distance from the place of raised benches.
Now, the crowd pressing thickly, the earth crust at
one point trembled, cracked, gave way. Scaffolding
and throng came with groans and cries into a
very cavern. Those that were left above, high on
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>narrow, overswaying platforms, with shouts of terror
pushed back from the pit mouth, managed with
accidents, injuries enough, to get to firmer earth.
Then began, among the braver sort, rescue of those
who had gone down with soil and timbers. What
with the darkness and the confused and sunken
ruin, this was difficult enough.</p>

<p>Ian and Alexander, unhurt, clambered down the
standing part and by the light of congregated and
improvised torches helped in that rescue, and helped
strongly. Many were pinned beneath wood, smothered
by the caving earth. The rent was wide and
in places the ruin afire. Groans, cries, appeals shook
the hearts of the carnival crowd. All would now
have helped, but it was not possible for many.
There must be strength to descend into the pit and
work there.</p>

<p>A beam pinned a man more than near a creeping
flame. The two Scots beat out that fire. Glenfernie
heaved away the beam, Ian drew out the man,
badly hurt, moaning of wife and child. Glenfernie
lifted him, mounted with him, over heaped debris,
by uncertain ledge and step, until other arms, outstretched,
could take him. Turning back, he took
from Ian a woman's form, lifted it forth. Down
again, the two worked on. Others were with
them, there was made a one-minded ring, folly
forgot.</p>

<p>At last it seemed that all were rescued. A few
men only moved now in the hollow, peering here and
there. The fire had taken headway; the gulf, it
was evident, would presently be filled with flame.
The heat beat back those at the rim. "Come out!
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>Come out, every one!" The rescuers began to
clamber forth.</p>

<p>Came down a roaring pile of red-lit timbers, with
smoke and sparks. It blocked the way for Alexander
and Ian. Turning, here threatened a pillar
of choking murk, red-tongued. Behind them was
a gaping, narrow archway. Involuntary recoil before
that stinging push of smoke brought them in
under this. They were in a passageway, but when
again they would have made forth and across to
the side of the pit, and so, by climbing, out of it,
they found that they could not. Before them lay
now a mere field of fire, and the blowing air drove
a biting smoke against them.</p>

<p>"Move back, until this burns itself out! The
earth gave into some kind of underground room.
This is a passage."</p>

<p>It stretched black behind them. Glenfernie caught
up a thick, arm-long piece of lighted wood that
would answer for brand. They worked through a
long vaulted tunnel, turned at right angles, and came
into what their torch showed to have been an
ancient chapel. In a niche stood a broken statue,
on the wall spread a painting of St. Christopher in
midstream.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on? There must be a way out of
this maze."</p>

<p>"If the torch will last us through."</p>

<p>They passed out of the chapel into a place where
of old the dead had been buried. They moved between
massy pillars, by the shelves of stone where
the bones lay in the dust. It seemed a great enough
hall. At the end of this they discovered an upward-<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>going
stair, but it was old and broken, and when
they mounted it they found that it ended flat against
thick stone, roof to it, pavement, perhaps, to some
old church. They saw by a difference in the flags
where had been space, the stair opening into the
hollow of the church; but now was only stone, solid
and thick. They struck against it, but it was moveless,
and in the church, if church there were above,
none in the dead night to hear them. They came
down the stair, and through a small, half-blocked
doorway stumbled into a labyrinth of passages and
narrow chambers. They found old pieces of wood&mdash;what
had been a wine-cask, what might have had
other uses. They broke these into torch lengths,
lighting one from another as that burned down.
These underways did not seem wholly neglected,
buried, and forgotten. There lacked any total
blocking or demolition, and there was air. But
intricacy and uncertainty reigned.</p>

<p>The mood of the amphitheater when they had
sat side by side claimed them still. There had been
a reversion or a coming into fresh space where quarrel
faded like a shadow before light. The light was
a golden, hazy one, made up of myriads of sublimed
memories, associations, judgments, conclusions.
Nothing defined emerged from it; it was simply
somewhat golden, somewhat warm light, as from a
sun well under the horizon&mdash;a kind of dreamy well-being
as of old Together, unquestioning Acceptance.
Suddenly aroused, each might have cried, "For the
moment&mdash;it was for a moment only!" Then, for
the moment, there was return, with addition. It
came like a winged force from the bounds of doing
<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>or undoing. While it lasted it imposed upon them
quieted minds, withdrew any seeming need for question.
They sought for egress from this place where
their bodies moved, explanation of this material
labyrinth. But they did not seek explanation of
this mood, fallen among pride and anger, wrong and
revenge. It came from at large, with the power of
largeness. They were back, "for the moment," in
a simplicity of ancient, firm companionship.</p>

<p>They spoke scarcely at all. It had been a habit
of old, in their much adventuring together, to do so
in long silences. Alexander had set the pace there,
Ian learning to follow.... It was as if this were an
adventure of, say, five years ago, and it was as if it
were a dream adventure. Or it was as if some part
of themselves, quietly and with a hidden will separating
itself, had sailed away from the huge storm
and cloud and red lightnings.... What they did say
had wholly and only to do with immediate exigencies.
Behind, in pure feeling, was the unity.</p>

<p>Down in this underground place the air began to
come more freshly.</p>

<p>"Look at the flame," said Ian. "It is bending."</p>

<p>They had left behind rooms and passages lined
with unbroken masonry. Here were newer chambers
and excavations, softer walled.</p>

<p>"They have been opening from this side. That
was dug not so long ago."</p>

<p>Another minute and they came into a ragged,
cavern-like space filled with fresh night air. Presently
they were forth upon a low hillside, and at
their feet Tiber mirrored the stars. Rome lay
around. The carnival lights yet flared, the carnival
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>noise beat, beat. This was a deserted strip, an islet
between restless seas.</p>

<p>Ian and Alexander stood upon trodden earth and
grass, about them the yet encumbering ruins of an
ancient building, pillars and architraves and capitals,
broken friezes and headless caryatids. Here
was the river, here the ancient street. They
breathed in the air, they looked at the sky, but then
at Rome. Somewhere a trumpet was fiercely crying.
Like an impatient hand, like a spurred foot,
it tore the magician's fabric of the past few hours.</p>

<p>Ian laughed. "We had best rub our eyes!" To
the fine hearing there was a catch of the breath,
a small dancing hope in his laughter. "<i>Or, Glenfernie,
shall we dream on?</i>"</p>

<p>But the other opened his eyes upon things like
the Kelpie's Pool and the old room in the keep
where a figure like himself read letters that lied.
He saw in many places a figure like himself, injured
and fooled, stuck full of poisoned arrows.
The figure grew as he watched it, until it overloomed
him, until he was passionately its partisan. He
said no word, but he flung the smoking torch yet
held in hand among the ruins, and, leaving Ian and
his black and silver, plunged down the slope to the
old, old street along which now poured a wave
of carnival.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>The laird of Glenfernie lay in the flowering
grass, beneath a pine-tree, rising lonely from the
Roman Campagna. The grass flowed for miles,
a multitudinous green speculating upon other colors,
here and there clearly donning a gold, an amethyst,
a blue. The pine-tree looked afar to other pine-trees.
Each seemed solitary. Yet all had the oneness
of the great stage, and if it could comprehend
the stage might swim with its little solitariness into a
wider uniqueness. In the distance lay Rome. He
could see St. Peter's dome. But around streamed
the ocean of grass and the ocean of air. Lifted from
the one, bathed in the other, strewed afar, appeared the
wreckage of an older Rome. There was no moving
in Rome or its Campagna without moving among
time-cleansed bones and vestiges. Rome and its
Campagna were like Sargasso Seas and held the
hulks of what had been great galleons. The air
swam above endless grass, endless minute flowers.
In long perspective traveled the arches of an Aqueduct.</p>

<p>He lay in the shadow of a broken tomb. It was
midspring. The bland stillness of this world was
grateful to him, after long inner storm. He lay
motionless, not far from the skirts of Contemplation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>The long line of the Aqueduct, arch after arch,
succession fixed, sequence which the gaze made
unitary, toled on his thought. He was regarding
span after span of imagery held together, a very
wide and deep landscape of numerous sequences,
more planes than one. He was seeing, around the
cells, the shadowy force lines of the organ, around
the organ the luminous mist of the organism. He
passed calmly from one great landscape to another.</p>

<p>Rome. To-day and yesterday and the day before,
and to-morrow. The "to-morrow" put in the
life, guaranteeing an endless present, endless breathing.
He saw Rome the giant, the stone and earth
of her, the vast animal life of her, the vast passional,
the mental clutch and hammer-blow. The spiritual
Rome? He sought it&mdash;it must be there. At last,
among the far arches, it rose, a light, a leaven, an
ether.... Rome.</p>

<p>If there were boundaries in this ocean of air
they were gauze-thin and floating. He looked here
and there, into landscapes Rome led to. Like and
like, and synthesis of syntheses! Images, finding
that of which they were images, lost their grotesqueness
or meaninglessness of line, their quality of
caricature, lost unripeness, lost the dull annoy of
riddles never meant to be answered.... He had a
great fund of images, material so full that it must
begin to build higher. Building higher meant arrival
in a fluid world where all aggregates were
penetrable.</p>

<p>He lay still among the grasses, and it was as though
he lay also amid the wide, simple, first growths of
a larger, more potent living. Now and again,
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>through years, he had been aware of approaches,
always momentary, to this condition, to a country
that lay behind time and space, cause and effect,
as he ordinarily knew them. The lightning went&mdash;but
always left something transforming. And then
for three years all gleams stopped, a leaden wall
that they could not pierce rearing itself.</p>

<p>Latterly they had begun to return.... The proud
will might rise against them, but they came. Then
it must be so, he would have said of another, that the
will was divided. Part of it must still have kept
its seat before the door whence the lights came,
stayed there with its face in its hands, waiting its
season. And a part that had said no must be
coming to say yes, going and taking its place beside
the other by the door. And together they were
strong enough to bring the gleaming back, watching
the propitious moment. But still there was the
opposed will, and it was strong.... When the light
came it sought out old traces of itself, and these became
revivified. Then all joined together to make
a flood against the abundant darkness. A day like
this joined itself through likeness to others on the
other side of the three years, and also to moments
of the months just passed and passing. Union
was made with a sleepless night in an inn of Spain,
with the hours after his encounter with Ian in the
Paris theater, with that time he sat upon the river
steps and saw that the dead were living and the
prisoners free, with the hour in the amphitheater
and after, in carnival.</p>

<p>He saw and heard, felt and tasted, life in greater
lengths and breadths. He comprehended more of
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>the pattern. The tones and semi-tones fell into the
long scale. Such moments brought always elevation,
deep satisfaction.... More of the will particles
traveled from below to the center by the door.</p>

<p>The soul turned the mind and directed it upon
Alexander Jardine's own history. It spread like a
landscape, like a continent viewed from the air,
and here it sang with attainment and here it had
not attained; and here it was light, and here there
were darknesses; right-doing here and wrong-doing
there and every shade between. He saw that there
was right- and wrong-doing quite outside of conventional
standards.</p>

<p>Where were frontiers? The edges of the continent
were merely spectral. Where did others end and
he begin, or he end and others begin? He saw that
his history was very wide and very deep and very
high. Through him faintly, by nerve paths in the
making, traveled the touch of oneness.</p>

<p>Alexander Jardine&mdash;Elspeth Barrow&mdash;Ian Rullock.
And all others&mdash;and all others.</p>

<p>There swam upon him another great perspective.
He saw Christ in light, Buddha in light. The glorified&mdash;the
unified. <i>Union.</i></p>

<p>Alexander Jardine&mdash;Elspeth Barrow&mdash;Ian Rullock.
And all others&mdash;and all others. <i>For we are
members, one of another.</i></p>

<p>The feathered, flowered grass, miles of it, and
the sea of air.... By degrees the level of consciousness
sank. The splendid, steadfast moment could
not be long sustained. Consciousness drew difficult
breath in the pure ether, it felt weight, it sank.
Alexander moved against the old tomb, turned, and
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>buried his face in his arms. The completer moment
went by, here was the torn self again. But he
strove to find footing on the thickening impressions
of all such moments.</p>

<p>Moving back to Rome, along the old way where
had marched all the legions, by the ruins, under the
blue sky, he had a sense of going with C&aelig;sar's
legions, step by step, targe by targe, and then of
his footstep halting, turning out, breaking rhythm.... From
this it was suddenly a winter night and at
Glenfernie, and he sat by the fire in his father's
death-room. His father spoke to him from the
bed and he went to his side and listened to dying
words, distilled from a wide garden that had relaxed
into bitterness, growths, and trails of ideal
hatred.... <i>What was it, setting one's foot upon
an adder?... What was the adder?</i></p>

<p>He entered the city. His lodging was above the
workroom and shop of a recoverer of ancient coins
and intaglios, skilful cleanser and mender of these
and merchant to whom would buy. The man was
artist besides, maker of strange drawings whom few
ever understood or bought.</p>

<p>Glenfernie liked him&mdash;an elderly, fine, thin, hook-nosed,
dark-eyed, subtle-lipped, little-speaking personage.
No great custom came to the shop in
front; the owner of it might work all day in the
room behind, with only two or three peals of a
small silvery summoning bell. The lodger acquired
the habit of sitting for perhaps an hour out of each
twenty-four in this workroom. He might study at
the window gem or coin and the finish of old designs,
or he might lift and look at sheet after sheet
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>of the man's drawings, or watch him at his work, or
have with him some talk.</p>

<p>The drawings had a fascination for him. "What
did you mean behind this outward meaning? Now
here I see this, and I see that, but here I don't
penetrate." The man laid down his mending a
broken Eros and came and stood by the table and
spoke. Glenfernie listened, the wood propping
elbow, the hand propping chin, the eyes upon the
drawing. Or he leaned back in the great visitor's
chair and looked instead at the draftsman. They
were strange drawings, and the draftsman's models
were not materially visible.</p>

<p>To-day Glenfernie came from the noise of Rome
without into this room. His host was sitting before
a drawing-board. Alexander stood and looked.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to bring the world of the plane
up a dimension? Then you work from an idea
above the world of the solid?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si.</i> Up a dimension."</p>

<p>"What are these forms?"</p>

<p>"I am dreaming the new eye, the new ear, the
new hand."</p>

<p>Glenfernie watched the moving and the resting
hand. Later in the day he returned to the room.</p>

<p>"It has been a fertile season," said the artist.
"Look!"</p>

<p>At the top of a sheet of paper was written large
in Latin, <span class="smcap">love is blind</span>. Beneath stood a figure
filled with eyes. "It is the same thing," said the
man.</p>

<p>The next day, at sunset, going up to his room
after restless wandering in this city, he found there
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>from Ian another intimation of the latter's movements:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Glenfernie</span>,&mdash;I am going northward. There will be a
month spent at monseigneur's villa upon the Lake of Como.
Then France again.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ian Rullock</span>.</p></div>

<p>Alexander laid the paper upon the table before
him, and now he stared at it, and now he gazed
at space beyond, and where he gazed seemed dark
and empty. It was deep night when finally he
dipped quill into ink and wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Ian Rullock</span>,&mdash;Stay or go as you will! I do not follow you
now as I did before. I come to see the crudeness, the barrenness,
of that. But within&mdash;oh, are you not my enemy still?
I ask Justice that, and what can she do but echo back my words?
"Within" is a universe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alexander Jardine</span>.</p></div>

<p>Five days later he knew that Ian with the Frenchman
in whose company he was had departed Rome.
On that morning he went again without the city and
lay among the grasses. But the sky to-day was
closed, and all dead Rome that had been proud
or violent or a lover of self seemed to move around
him multitudinous. He fought the shapes down,
but the sea in storm then turned sluggish, dead and
weary.... What was he going to do? Scotland?
Was he going back to Scotland? The glen, the moor,
White Farm and the kirk, Black Hill and his own
house&mdash;all seemed cold and without tint, gray,
small, and withered, and yet oppressive. All that
would be importunate, officious. He cried out,
"O my God, I want healing!" For a long time he
<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>lay there still, then, rising, went wandering by arches
and broken columns, choked doorways, graved slabs
sunken in fairy jungles. Into his mind came a journey
years before when he had just brushed a desert.
The East, the Out-of-Europe, called to him now.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p>Ian guided the boat to the water steps. Above,
over the wall, streamed roses, a great, soundless
fall of them, reflected, mass and color, in the lake.
Above the roses sprang deep trees, shade behind
shade, and here sang nightingales. Facing him sat
the Milanese song-bird, the singer Antonia Castinelli.
She had the throat of the nightingale and the beauty
of the velvety open rose.</p>

<p>"Why land?" she said. "Why climb the steps
to the chatter in the villa?"</p>

<p>"Why indeed?"</p>

<p>"They are not singing! They are talking. There
is deep, sweet shadow around that point."</p>

<p>The boat turned glidingly. Now it was under
tall rock, parapeted with trees.</p>

<p>"Let Giovanni have the boat. Come and sit
beside me! You are too far away for singing together."</p>

<p>Old Giovanni at the helm, boatman upon this
lake since youth, used long since to murmuring words,
to touching hands, stayed brown and wrinkled and
silent and unspeculative as a walnut. Perhaps his
mind was sunk in his own stone hut behind vine
leaves. The two under the rose-and-white-fringed
canopy leaned toward each other.</p>

<p><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>"Tell me of your strange, foreign land! Have
you roses there&mdash;roses&mdash;roses? And nightingales
that sing out your heart under the moon?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you of the heather, the lark, and the
mavis."</p>

<p>She listened. "Oh, it does not taste as tastes
this lake! Give me pain! Tell me of women you
have loved.... Oh, hear! The nightingales stop
singing."</p>

<p>"Do you ever listen to the silence?"</p>

<p>"Of course ... when a friend dies&mdash;or I go to
Mass&mdash;and sometimes when I am singing very passionately.
But this lake&mdash;"</p>

<p>She began to sing. The contralto throbbed,
painted, told, brought delight and melancholy. He
sat with his hand loosened from hers, his eyes upon
the lake's blue-green depths. At last she stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;h!... Let us go back to the talking shore
and the chattering villa! Somebody else is singing&mdash;somebody
or something! I hear silence&mdash;I hear it
in the silence.... Some things I can sing against,
and some things I can't."</p>

<p>They went underneath the wall of roses. Her
arm, sleeved as with mist, touched his; her low,
wide brow and great liquid eyes were at his shoulder,
at his breast. "O foreigner&mdash;and yet not at all
foreign! Tell me your English words for roses&mdash;walls
of roses&mdash;and music that never ceases in the
night&mdash;and pleasing, pleasing, pleasing love!"</p>

<p>The boat came to the water steps. The two left
it, climbing between flowers. Down to them came
a wave of laughter and hand-clapping.</p>

<p>"Celestina recites&mdash;but I do not think she does
<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>it so well!... That is my window&mdash;see, where the
roses mount!"</p>

<p>The company, flowing forth, caught them upon
the terrace. "Lo, the truants!"</p>

<p>But that night, instead of climbing where the
roses climbed, he took a boat from the number
moored by the steps and rowed himself across the
lake to a piece of shore, bare of houses, lifting by
steep slope and crag into the mountain masses.
He fastened the boat and climbed here. The moon
was round, the night merely a paler day. He went
up among low trees and bushes until he came to
naked rock. He climbed here as far as he might,
found some manner of platform, and threw himself
down, below him the lake, around him the
mountains.</p>

<p>He lay still until the expended energy was replaced.
At last the mind moved and, apprentice-bound
to feeling, began again a hot and heavy and
bitter work, laid aside at times and then renewed.
It was upon the vindication to himself of Ian
Rullock.</p>

<p>It was made to work hard.... Its old task used
to be to keep asleep upon the subject. But now for
a considerable time this had been its task. Old
feeling, old egoism, awakened up and down, drove
it hard! It had to make bricks without straw. It
had to fetch and carry from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Emotion, when it must rest, provided for it a dull
place of listlessness and discontent. But the taskmaster
now would have it up at all hours, fashioning
reasons and justifications. The soonest found straw
in the fields lay in the faults of others&mdash;of the world
<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>in general and Alexander Jardine in particular.
Feeling got its anodyne in gloating over these. It
had the pounce of a panther for such a bitter berry,
such a weed, such a shameful form. It did not
always gloat, but it always held up and said, <i>Who
could be weaker here&mdash;more open to question?</i> It made
constant, sore comparison.</p>

<p>The lake gleamed below him, the herded mountains
slept in a gray silver light. How many were
the faults of the laird of Glenfernie! Faults! He
looked at the dark old plains of the moon. That was
a light word! He saw Alexander pitted and scarred.</p>

<p>Pride! That had always been in the core of
Glenfernie. That has been his old fortress, walled
and moated against trespass. Pride so high that
it was careless&mdash;that its possessor could seem peaceable
and humble.... But find the quick and touch
it&mdash;and you saw! What was his was his. What
he deemed to be his, whether it was so or not!
Touch him there and out jumped jealousy, hate,
and implacableness&mdash;and all the time one had
been thinking of him as a kind of seer!</p>

<p>Ian turned upon the rock above Como. And
Glenfernie was ignorant! The seer had seen very
little, after all. His touch had not been precisely permeative
when it came to the world, Ian Rullock.
If liking meant understanding, there had not been
much understanding&mdash;which left liking but a word.
If liking was a degree of love, where then had been
love, where the friend at all? After all, and all the
time, Glenfernie's notion of friendship was a sieve.
The notion that he had held up as though it were
the North Star!</p>

<p><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>The world, Ian Rullock, could not be so contemned....</p>

<p>He felt with heat and pain the truth of that. It
was a wrong that Glenfernie should not understand!
The world, Ian Rullock, might be incomplete, imperfect&mdash;might
have taken, more than once, wrong
turns, left its path, so to speak, in the heavens.
But what of the world, Alexander Jardine? Had it
no memories? He brooded over what these memories
might be&mdash;must be; he tried to taste and
handle that other's faults in time and space. But
he could not plunge into Alexander's depths of
wrath. As he could not, he made himself contemptuous
of all that&mdash;of Old Steadfast's power of
reaction!</p>

<p>A star shot across the moon-filled night, so large
a meteor that it made light even against that silver.
A mass within Ian made a slow turn, with effort,
with thrilling, changed its inclination. He saw
that disdain, that it was shallow and streaked with
ebony. He moved with a kind of groan. "Was
there&mdash;is there&mdash;wickedness?... What, O God, is
wickedness?"</p>

<p>He pressed the rock with his hand&mdash;sat up. The
old taskmaster, alarmed, gathered his forces. "I
say that it is just that&mdash;pride, vengefulness, hard
misunderstanding!"</p>

<p>A voice within him answered. "Even so, is it
not still yourself?"</p>

<p>He stared after the meteor track. There was a
conception here that he had not dreamed of.</p>

<p>It seemed best to keep still upon the rock. He
sat in inner wonder. There was a sense of purity,
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>of a fresh coolness not physical, of awe. He was
in presence of something comprehensive, immortal.</p>

<p>"Is it myself? Then let it pour out and make of
naught the old poison of myself!"</p>

<p>The perception could not hold. It flagged and
sank, echoing down into the caves. He sat still
and felt the old taskmaster stir. But this time he
found strength to resist. There resulted, not the
divine novelty and largeness of that one moment,
but a kind of dim and bare desert waste of wide extent.
And as it ate up all width, so it seemed timeless.
Across this, like a person, unheralded, came
and went two lines from "Richard III"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Clarence is come&mdash;false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It went and left awareness of the desert. "False&mdash;fleeting&mdash;perjured...."</p>

<p>He saw himself as in mirrors.</p>

<p>The desert ached and became a place of thorns
and briers and bewilderment. Then rose, like Ant&aelig;us,
the taskmaster. "<i>And what of all that&mdash;if I
like life so?</i>"</p>

<p>Sense of the villa and the roses and the nightingales
in the coverts&mdash;sense of wide, mobile sweeps
and flowing currents inwashing, indrawing, pleasure-crafts
great and small&mdash;desire and desire for desire&mdash;lust
for sweetness, lust for salt&mdash;the rose to be
plucked, the grapes to be eaten&mdash;and all for self,
all for Ian....</p>

<p>He started up from the rock above Como, and
turned to descend to the boat. That within him
that set itself to make thin cloud of the taskmaster
<a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>pulled him back as by the hair of the head and cast
him down upon the rocky floor.</p>

<p>He lay still, half upon his face buried in the
bend of his arm. He felt misery.</p>

<p>"My soul is sick&mdash;a beggar&mdash;like to become an
outcast!"</p>

<p>How long he lay here now he did not know.
The nadir of night was passed, but there was cold
and voidness, an abyss. He felt as one fallen from
a great height long ago. "There is no help here!
Let me only go to an eternal sleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wind began. In the east the sky grew whiter
than elsewhere. There came a sword-blow from an
unseen hand, ripping and tearing veils. <i>Elspeth&mdash;Elspeth
Barrow!</i></p>

<p>In a bitterness as of myrrh he came into touch with
cleanness, purity, wholeness. Henceforth there was
invisible light. Its first action was not to show him
scorchingly the night of Egypt, but with the quietness
of the whitening east to bring a larger understanding
of Elspeth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p>The caravan, having spent three days in a town
the edge of the desert, set forth in the afternoon.
The caravan was a considerable one. Three
hundred camels, more than a hundred asses, went
heavily laden. Twenty men rode excellent horses;
ten, poorer steeds; the company of others mounted
with the merchandise or, staff in hand, strode beside.
In safe stretches occurred a long stringing out, with
lagging at the rear; in stretches where robber bands
or other dangers might be apprehended things became
compact. Besides traders and their employ,
there rode or walked a handful of chance folk who
had occasion for the desert or for places beyond it.
These paid some much, some little, but all something
for the advantage of this convoy. The traders
did not look to lose, whoever went with them.
Altogether, several hundred men journeyed in
company.</p>

<p>The elected chief of the caravan was a tall Arab,
Zeyn al-Din. Twelve of the camels were his; he
was a merchant of spices, of wrought stuff, girdles,
and gems&mdash;a man of forty, bold and with scope.
He rode a fine horse and kept usually at the head of
the caravan. But now and again he went up and
down, seeing to things. Then there was talking,
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>loud or low, between the head man and units of the
march.</p>

<p>Starting from its home city, this caravan had
been for two days in good spirits. Then had become
to creep in disaster, not excessive, but persistent.
One thing and another befell, and at last
a stealing sickness, none knew what, attacking both
beast and man. They had made the town at the
edge of the desert. Physicians were found and rest
taken. Recuperation and trading proceeded amicably
together. The day of departure wheeling
round, the noontide prayer was made with an especial
fervor and attention. Then from the <i>caravanserai</i>
forth stepped the camels.</p>

<p>The sun descending, the caravan threw a giant
shadow upon the sand. Ridge and wave of sterile
earth broke it, confused it, made it an unintelligible,
ragged, moving, and monstrous shade. The sun
was red and huge. As it lowered to the desert rim
Zeyn al-Din gave the order for the seven-hour halt.
The orb touched the sand; prayer carpets were
spread.</p>

<p>Night of stars unnumbered, the ineffable tent,
arched the desert. The caravan, a small thing in
the world, lay at rest. The meal was over. Here
was coolness after heat, repose after toil. The fires
that had been kindled from scrub and waste lessened,
died away. Zeyn al-Din appointed the guards for
the night, went himself the rounds.</p>

<p>Where one of the fires had burned he found certain
of those men who were not merchants nor servants
of merchants, yet traveled with the caravan.
Here were Hassan the Scribe, and Ali the Wanderer,
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>and the dervish Abdallah, and others. Here was the
big Christian from some outlandish far-away country,
who had dwelt for the better part of a year in the
city whence the caravan started, who had money
and a wish to reach the city toward which the
caravan journeyed. In the first city he had become,
it seemed, well liked by Yusuf the Physician, that
was the man that Zeyn al-Din most admired in
life. It was Yusuf who had recommended the
Christian to Zeyn, who did not like infidel sojourners
with caravans. Zeyn himself was liberal and did
not so much mind, but he had had experience with
troubles created along the way and in the column
itself. The more ignorant or the stiffer sort thought
it unpleasing to Allah. But Zeyn al-Din would do
anything really that Yusuf the Physician wanted.
So in the end the big Christian came along. Zeyn,
interpreting fealty to Yusuf to mean care in some
measure for this infidel's well-being, began at once
with a few minutes' riding each day beside him.
These insensibly expanded to more than a few.
He presently liked the infidel. "He is a man!" said
Zeyn and that was the praise that he considered
highest. The big Christian rode strongly a strong
horse; he did not fret over small troubles nor apparently
fear great ones; he did not say, "This is
my way," and infer that it was better than others;
he liked the red camel, the white, and the brown.
"Who dances with the sand is not stifled," said
Zeyn.</p>

<p>Now he found the Christian with Hassan, listening
at ease, stretched upon the sand, to Ali the
Wanderer. The head man, welcomed, listened, too,
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>to Ali bringing his story to a close. "That is good,
Ali the Wanderer! Just where grows the tree from
which one gathers that fruit?"</p>

<p>"It can't be told unless you already know," said
Ali.</p>

<p>"Allah my refuge! Then I would not be asking
you!" answered Zeyn. "I should have shaken the
tree and gathered the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds,
and been off with them!"</p>

<p>"You did not hear what was said. Ibn the
Happy found that they could not be taken from the
tree. He had tried what you propose. He broke
off a great number and ran away with them. But
they turned to black dust in his bosom. He put
them all down, and when he looked back he saw
them still shining on the tree."</p>

<p>"What did Ibn the Happy do?"</p>

<p>"He climbed into the tree and lived there."</p>

<p>In the distance jackals were barking. "I like
nothing better than listening to stories," said Zeyn
al-Din. "But, Allah! Just now there are more
important things to do! Yusuf the Red, I name
you watcher here until moonrise. Then waken
Melec, who already sleeps there!"</p>

<p>His eyes touched in passing the big Christian.
"Oh yes, you would be a good watcher," thought
Zeyn. "But there's a folly in this caravan! Wait
till good fortune has a steadier foot!"</p>

<p>But good fortune continued a wavering, evanishing
thing. Deep in the night, from behind a stiffened
wave of earth, rose and dashed a mounted
band of Bedouin robbers. Yusuf the Red and other
watchers had and gave some warning. Zeyn al-<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>Din's
voice was presently heard like a trumpet.
The caravan repelled the robbers. But five of its
number were lost, some camels and mules driven off.
The Bedouins departing with wild cries, there were
left confusion and bewailing, slowly straightening,
slowly sinking. The caravan, with a pang, recognized
that ill luck was a traveler with it.</p>

<p>The dead received burial; the wounded were
looked to, at last hoisted, groaning, upon the camels,
among the merchandise. Unrested, bemoaning loss,
the trading company made their morning start
three hours behind the set time. For stars in the
sky, there was the yellow light and the sun at a
bound, strewing heat. In the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e the robbers
had thrust lance or knife into several of the water-skins.
Yet there was, it was held, provision enough.
The caravan went on. At midday the Bedouins returned,
reinforced. Zeyn al-Din and his mustered
force beat them off. No loss of goods or life, but
much of time! The caravan went on, that with
laden beasts must move at best much like a tortoise.
That night the rest was shortened. Two
hours after midnight and the strings of camels were
moving again, the asses and mules so monstrously
misshapen with bales of goods, the horses and horsemen
and those afoot. At dawn, not these Bedouins,
but another roving band, harassed them. Time
was running like water from a cracked pitcher.</p>

<p>This day they cleared the robber bands. There
spread before them, around them, clean desert.
Then returned that sickness.</p>

<p>"<i>O Zeyn al-Din, what could we expect who travel
with him who denies Allah?</i>"</p>

<p><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>The stricken caravan crept under the blaze
across the red waste. Camels fell and died. Their
burdens were lifted from them and added to the
packs of others; their bodies were left to light
and heat and moving air.... It grew that an enchantment
seemed to hold the feet of the caravan.
Evils came upon them, sickness of men and beasts.
And now it was seen that there was indeed little
water.</p>

<p>"O Zeyn al-Din, rid us of this infidel!"</p>

<p>"The infidel is in you!" answered Zeyn al-Din.
"Much speaking makes for thirst and impedes
motion. Let us cross this desert."</p>

<p>"O Zeyn al-Din, if you be no right head man we
shall choose another!"</p>

<p>"Choose!" said Zeyn al-Din, and went to the
head of a camel who would not rise from the sand.</p>

<p>Ill luck clung and clung. Twelve hours and there
began to be cabals. These grew to factions. The
larger of these swallowed the small fry, swelled and
mounted, took the shape of practically the whole
caravan. "Zeyn al-Din, if you do not harken to
us it will be the worse for you! Drive away the
Christian dog!"</p>

<p>"Abu al-Salam, are you the chief, or I?&mdash;Now,
companions, listen! These are the reasons in nature
for our troubles&mdash;"</p>

<p>But no! It was the noon halt. The desert swam
in light and silence. The great majority of the
traders and their company undertook to play divining,
judging, determining Allah. The big Christian
stood over against them and looked at them,
his arms folded.</p>

<p><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>"It is no such great matter!... Very good then!
What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Turn your head and your eyes from us, and go
to what fate Allah parcels out to you!"</p>

<p>There arose a buzzing. "Better we slay him
here and now! So Allah will know our side!"</p>

<p>Zeyn al-Din stepped forth. "This is the friend
of my friend and I am pledged. Slay, and you will
have two to slay! O Allah! what a thing it is to
stare at the west when the riders are in the east!"</p>

<p>"Zeyn al-Din, we have chosen for head man Abu
al-Salam."</p>

<p>"Allah with you! I should say you had chosen
well. I have twelve camels," said Zeyn al-Din.
"I make another caravan! Mansur, Omar, and
Melec, draw you forth my camels and mules!"</p>

<p>With a weaker man there might have been interference,
stoppage. But Zeyn's mass and force acquired
clear space for his own movements. He
made his caravan. He had with him so many men.
Three of these stood by him; the others cowered
into the great caravan, into the shadow of Abu al-Salam.</p>

<p>Zeyn threw a withering look. "Oh, precious is
the skin!"</p>

<p>The big infidel came to him. "Zeyn al-Din, I
do not want all this peril for me. I have ridden
away alone before to-day. Now I shall go in that
direction, and I shall find a garden."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall find it," said Zeyn. "Does
any other go with my caravan?"</p>

<p>It seemed that Ali the Wanderer went, and the
dervish Abdallah.... There was more ado, but at
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>last the caravan parted.... The great one, the long
string of beads, drew with slow toil across the waste,
along the old track. The very small one, the tiny
string of beads, departed at right angles. Space
grew between them. The dervish Abdallah turned
upon his camel.</p>

<p>"It seems that we part. But, O Allah! around
'We part' is drawn 'We are together!'"</p>

<p>Zeyn al-Din made a gesture of assent. "O I
shall meet in bazaars Abu al-Salam! 'Ha! Zeyn
al-Din!'&mdash;'Ha! Abu al-Salam!'"</p>

<p>The sun sank lower. The vastly larger caravan
drew away, drew away, over the desert rim. Between
the two was now a sea of desert waves.
Where the great string of camels, the asses, the
riders, the men could be seen, all were like little
figures cut from dark paper, drawn by some invisible
finger, slowly, slowly across a wide floor. Before
long there were only dots, far in the distance.
Around Zeyn al-Din's caravan swept a great solitude.</p>

<p>"Halt!" said Zeyn. "Now they observe us no
longer, and this is what we do!"</p>

<p>All the merchant lading was taken from the
camels. The bales of wealth strewed the sand.
"Wealth is a comfortable garment," said Zeyn,
"but life is a richer yet! That which gathers wealth
is wealth. Now we shall go thrice as fast as Abu
al-Salam!"</p>

<p>"Far over there," said Ali the Wanderer, and
nodded his head toward the quarter, "is the small
oasis called the Garland."</p>

<p>"I have heard of it, though I have not been
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>there," answered Zeyn. "Well, we shall not rest
to-night; we shall ride!"</p>

<p>They rode in the desert beneath the stars, going
fast, camels and horses, unencumbered by bales and
packs unwieldy and heavy. But there were guarded,
as though they were a train of the costliest merchandise,
the shrunken water-skins....</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie, riding in silence by Zeyn
al-Din, whom he had thanked once with emphasis,
and then had accepted as he himself was accepted,
looked now at the desert and now at the stars and
now at past things. A year and more&mdash;he had been
a year and more in the East. If you had it in you
to grow, the East was good growing-ground.... He
looked toward the stars beneath which lay Scotland.</p>

<p>The night passed. The yellow dawn came up,
the sun and the heat of day. And they must still
press on.... At last the horses could not do that.
At eve they shot the horses, having no water for
them. They went on upon camels. Great suffering
came upon them. They went stoically, the
Arabs and the Scot. The eternal waste, the sand,
the arrows of the sun.... The most of the camels
died. Day and night and morn, and, almost dead
themselves, the men saw upon the verge the palms
of the desert oasis called the Garland.</p>

<hr style='width: 33%;' />

<p>Seven men dwelt seven days in the Garland.
Uninhabited it stood, a spring, date-palms, lesser
verdure, a few birds and small beasts and winged
insects. It was an emerald set in ashy gold.</p>

<p>The dervish Abdallah sat in contemplation under
a palm. Ali the Wanderer lay and dreamed. Zeyn
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>al-Din and his men, Mansur, Omar, and Melec,
were as active as time and place admitted. The
camels tasted rich repose. Day went by in dry
light, in a pleasant rustling and waving of palm
fronds. Night sprang in starshine, wonderful soft
lamps orbed in a blue vault. Presently was born
and grew a white moon.</p>

<p>Alexander Jardine, standing at the edge of the
emerald, watched it. He could not sleep. The first
nights in the Garland he with the others had slept
profoundly. But now there was recuperation,
strength again. Around swept the circle of the
desert. Above him he saw Canopus.</p>

<p>He ceased to look directly at the moon, or the
desert, or Canopus. He stretched himself upon the
clear sand and was back in the inner vast that
searched for the upper vast. Since the grasses of
the Campagna there had been a long search, and
his bark had encountered many a wind, head winds
and favoring winds, and had beaten from coast
to coast.</p>

<p>"O God, for the open, divine sea and Wisdom
the compass&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lay beneath the palm; he put his arm over his
eyes. For an hour he had been whelmed in an old
sense, bitter and stately, of the woe, the broken
knowledge, the ailing and the pain of the world.
All the world.... That other caravan, where was
it?... Where were all caravans? And all the bewilderment
and all the false hopes and all the fool's
paradises. All the crying in the night. Children....</p>

<p>Little by little he recognized that he was seeing
it as panorama.... None saw a panorama until one
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>was out of the plane of its components&mdash;out of the
immediate plane. Gotten out as all must get out,
by the struggling Thought, which, the thing done,
uses its eyes....</p>

<p>He looked at his past. He did not beat his breast
nor cry out in repentance, but he saw with a kind
of wonder the plains of darkness. Oh, the deserts,
and the slow-moving caravans in them!</p>

<p>He lay very still beneath the palm. All the
world.... <i>All.</i></p>

<p>"<i>All is myself.</i>"</p>

<p>"Ian? Myself&mdash;myself&mdash;myself!"</p>

<p>He heard a step upon the sand&mdash;the putting by
of a branch. The Sufi Abdallah stood beside him.
Alexander made a movement.</p>

<p>"Lie still," said the other, "I will sit here, for
sweet is the night." He took his place, white-robed,
a gleaming upon the sand. Silent almost always,
it was nothing that he should sit silent now, quiet,
moveless, gone away apparently among the stars.</p>

<p>The moments dropped, each a larger round. Glenfernie
moved, sat up.</p>

<p>"I've felt you and your calm in our caravaning.
Let me see if my Arabic will carry me here!&mdash;What
have you that I have not and that I long for?"</p>

<p>"I have nought that you have not."</p>

<p>"But you see the having, and I do not."</p>

<p>"You are beginning to see."</p>

<p>The wind breathed in the oasis palms. The earth
turned, seeking the sun for her every chamber, the
earth made pilgrimage around the sun, eying point
after point of that excellence, the earth journeyed
with the sun, held by the invisible cords.</p>

<p><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>"I wish new sight&mdash;I wish new touch&mdash;I wish
comprehension!"</p>

<p>"You are beginning to have it."</p>

<p>"I have more than I had.... Yes, I know it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is birth.... Then comes the joy of birth.
At last comes the knowledge of why there is joy.
Strive to be fully born."</p>

<p>"And if I were so&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Then life alters and there is strong embrace."</p>

<p>A great stillness lay upon the oasis and the desert
around. Men and beasts were sleeping, only these
two waking, just here, just now. After a moment
the dervish spoke again. "The holder-back is the
sense of disunity. Sit fast and gather yourself to
yourself.... Then will you find how large is your
brood!"</p>

<p>He rose, stood a moment above Glenfernie, then
went away. The man whom he left sat on, struck
from within by fresh shafts. Perception now came
in this way, with inner beam. How huge was the
landscape that it lighted up!... Alexander sat still.
He bent his head&mdash;there was a sense, extending to
the physical, of a broken shell, of escape, freedom....
He found that he was weeping. He lay upon the
sand, and the tears came as they might from a young
boy. When they were past, when he lifted himself
again, the morning star was in the sky.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>


<p>Strickland, in the deep summer glen, saw
before him the feather of smoke from Mother
Binning's cot. The singing stream ran clearly, the
sky arched blue above. The air held calm and fine,
filled as it were with golden points. He met a white
hen and her brood, he heard the slow drone of
Mother Binning's wheel. She sat in the doorway,
an old wise wife, active still.</p>

<p>"Eh, mon, and it's you!&mdash;Wish, and afttimes ye'll
get!" She pushed her wheel aside. "I've had a
feeling a' the day!"</p>

<p>Strickland leaned against her ash-tree. "It's high
summer, Mother&mdash;one of the poised, blissful days."</p>

<p>"Aye. I've a feeling.... Hae ye ony news at the
House?"</p>

<p>"Alice sings beautifully this summer. Jamie is
marrying down in England&mdash;beauty and worth he
says, and they say."</p>

<p>"Miss Alice doesna marry?"</p>

<p>"She's not the marrying kind, she says."</p>

<p>"Eh, then! She's bonny and gude, juist the
same! Did ye come by White Farm?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Jarvis Barrow fails. He sits under his
fir-tree, with his Bible beside him and his eyes on
the hills. Littlefarm manages now for White Farm."</p>

<p><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>"Robin's sunny and keen. But he aye irked Jarvis
with his profane sangs." She drew out the adjective
with a humorous downward drag of her lip.</p>

<p>Strickland smiled. "The old man's softer now.
You see that by the places at which his Bible opens."</p>

<p>"Oh aye! We're journeyers&mdash;rock and tree and
Kelpie's Pool with the rest of us."</p>

<p>She seemed to catch her own speech and look at
it. "That's a word I hae been wanting the morn!&mdash;The
Kelpie's Pool, with the moor sae green and
purple around it." She sat bent forward, her
wrinkled hands in her lap, her eyes, rather wide,
fixed upon the ash-tree.</p>

<p>"We have not heard from the laird," said Strickland,
"this long time."</p>

<p>"The laird&mdash;now there! What ye want further
comes when the mind strains and then waits! I
see in one ring the day and Glenfernie and yonder
water. Wherever the laird be, he thinks to-day of
Scotland."</p>

<p>"I wish that he would think to returning," said
Strickland. He had been leaning against the doorpost.
Now he straightened himself. "I will go on
as far as the pool."</p>

<p>Mother Binning loosed her hands. "Did ye have
that thought when ye left hame?"</p>

<p>"No, I believe not."</p>

<p>"Gae on, then! The day's bonny, and the Lord's
gude has a wide ring!"</p>

<p>Strickland walking on, left the stream and the
glen head. Now he was upon the moor. It dipped
and rose like a Titan wave of a Titan sea. Its
long, long unbroken crest, clean line against clean
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>space, brought a sense of quiet, distance, might.
Here solitude was at home. Now Strickland moved,
and now he stood and watched the quiet. Turning
at last a shoulder of the moor, he saw at some distance
below him the pool, like a small mirror. He
descended toward it, without noise over the springy
earth.</p>

<p>A horse appeared between him and the water.
Strickland felt a most involuntary startling and
thrill&mdash;then half laughed to think that he had feared
that he saw the water-steed, the kelpie. The horse
was fastened to a stake that once had been the bole
of an ancient willow. It grazed around&mdash;somewhere
would be a master.... Presently Strickland's eye
found the latter&mdash;a man lying upon the moorside,
just above the water. Again with a shock and thrill&mdash;though
not like the first&mdash;it came to him who it
was.</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie lay very still, his eyes
upon the Kelpie's Pool. His old tutor, long his
friend, quiet and stanch, gazed unseen. When he
had moved a few feet an outcropping of rock hid
his form, but his eyes could still dwell upon the
pool and the man its visitor. He turned to go away,
then he stood still.</p>

<p>"What if he means a closer going yet?" Strickland
settled back against the rock. "He would
loose his horse first&mdash;he would not leave it fastened
here. If he does that then I will go down to him."</p>

<p>Glenfernie lay still. There was no wind to-day.
The reeds stood straight, the willow leaves slept,
the water stayed like dusky glass. The air, pure
and light, hung at rest in the ether. Minutes went
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>by, an hour. He might, Strickland thought, have
lain there a long time. At last he sat up, rose, began
to walk around the pool. He went around it
thrice. Then again he sat down, his arms upon
his knees, watching the dusk water. He did not
go nor sit like one overwrought or frenzied or despairing.
His great frame, his bearing, the air of
him, had quietude, but not listlessness; there seemed
at once calm and intensity as of a still center that
had flung off the storm. Time flowed. Thought
Strickland:</p>

<p>"He is as far as I am from death in that water.
I'll cease to spy."</p>

<p>He moved away, moss and ling muffling step,
gained and dipped behind the shoulder of the moor.
The horse grazed on. The laird sat still, his arms
upon his knees, his head a little lifted, his eyes crossing
the Kelpie's Pool to the wave-line against the sky.</p>

<p>Strickland went to where the moor path ran by
the outermost trees of the glen head. Here he sat
down beneath an oak and waited. Another hour
passed; then he heard the horse's hoofs. He rose
and met Glenfernie home-returning.</p>

<p>"It is good to see you, Strickland!"</p>

<p>"I found you yonder by the Kelpie's Pool. Then
I came here and waited."</p>

<p>"I have spent hours there.... They were not
unhappy. They were not at all unhappy."</p>

<p>They moved together along the moor track, the
horse following.</p>

<p>"I am glad and glad again that you have come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have been coming a good while. But there
were preventions."</p>

<p><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>"We have heard nothing direct for almost a
year."</p>

<p>"Then my letters did not reach you. I wrote,
but knew that they might not. There is the smoke
from Mother Binning's cot." He stood still to
watch the mounting feather. "I remember when
first I saw that, a six-year-old, climbing the glen
with my father, carried on his shoulder when I was
tired. I thought it was a hut in a fairy-tale....
So it is!"</p>

<p>To Strickland the remarkable thing lay in the lack
of strain, the simplicity and fullness. Glenfernie
was unfeignedly glad to see him, glad to see home
shapes and colors. The blue feather among the
trees had simply pleased him as it could not please
a heart fastened to rage and sorrow. The stream
of memories that it had beckoned&mdash;many others, it
must be, besides that of the six-year-old's visit&mdash;seemed
to have washed itself clear, to have disintegrated,
dissolved venom and stinging. Strickland,
pondering even while he talked, found the
word he wanted: "Comprehensiveness.... He always
tended to that."</p>

<p>Said Glenfernie, "I've had another birth, Strickland,
and all things are the same and yet not the
same." He gave it as an explanation, but then
left it. They were going the moorland way to
Glenfernie House. He was looking from side to
side, recovering old landscape in sweep and in detail.
Bit by bit, as they came to it, Strickland gave
him the country news. At last there was the house
before them, among the firs and oaks, topping the
crag. They came into the wood at the base of the
<a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>hill. The stream&mdash;the trees&mdash;above, the broken,
ancient wall, the roofs of the new house that was
not so new, the old, outstanding keep. The whole
rested, mellowed, lifted, still, against a serene and
azure sky. Alexander stood and gazed.</p>

<p>"The keep. The pine still knots and clings there
by the school-room. Do you remember, Strickland,
a day when you set me to read 'The Cranes of
Ibycus'?"</p>

<p>"I remember."</p>

<p>"Life within life, and sky above sky!&mdash;I hear
Bran!"</p>

<hr style='width: 33%;' />

<p>They mounted the hill. It seemed to run before
them that the laird had come home. Bran and
Davie and the men and maids and Alice, a bonny
woman, and Mrs. Grizel, very little withered, exclaimed
and ran. Tibbie Ross was there that day,
and Black Alan neighed from his stall. Even the
waving trees&mdash;even the flowers in the garden&mdash;Home,
and its taste and fragrance&mdash;its dear, close
emanations....</p>

<p>That evening at supper Mrs. Grizel made a remark.
She leaned back in her chair and looked at
Glenfernie. "I never thought you like your mother
before! Oh aye! there's your father, too, and a
kind of grand man he was, for all that he saw things
dark. But will you look, Mr. Strickland, and see
Margaret&mdash;"</p>

<p>Much later, from his own room, Strickland, gazing
forth, saw light in the keep. Alexander would
be sitting there among the books and every ancient
memorial. Strickland felt a touch of doubt and
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>apprehension. Suppose that to-morrow should find
not this Alexander, at once old and new, but only
the Alexander who had ridden from Glenfernie, who
had shipped to Lisbon, nearly three years ago?
To-day's deep satisfaction only a dream! Strickland
shook off the fear.</p>

<p>"He breathed lasting growth.... O Christ! the
help for all in winged men!"</p>

<p>He turned to his bed. Lying awake he went in
imagination to the desert, to the Eastern places,
that in few words the laird had painted.</p>

<p>And in the morning he found still the old-new
Alexander. He saw that the new had always been
in the old, the oak in the acorn.... There was a
great, sane naturalness in the alteration, in the advance.
Strickland caught glimpses of larger orders.</p>

<p>"<i>I will make thee ruler over many things.</i>"</p>

<p>The day was deep and bright. The laird fell at
once into the old routine. For none at Glenfernie
was there restlessness; there was only ache gone,
and a feeling of fulfilling. Mrs. Grizel pattered to
and fro. Alice sang like a lark, gathering pansy
seed from her garden. Phemie and Eppie sang.
The men whistled at their work. Davie discoursed
to himself. But Tibbie Ross was wild to get away
early and to the village with the news. By the
foot of the hill she began to meet wayfarers.</p>

<p>"Oh, aye, this is the real weather! Did ye know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alexander did not leave home that day. In
their old work-room he listened to Strickland's account
of his stewardship.</p>

<p>"Strickland, I love you!" he said, when it was all
given.</p>

<p><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>He wrote to Jamie; he sat in the garden seat
built against the garden wall and watched Alice
as she moved from plant to plant.</p>

<p>"You do not say much," thought Alice, "but
I like you&mdash;I like you&mdash;I like you!"</p>

<p>In the afternoon Strickland met him coming from
the little green beyond the school-room.</p>

<p>"I have been out through the wall, under the old
pine. I seemed to hold many things in the palm
of the hand.... I believe that you know what it is
to make essences."</p>

<p>After bedtime Strickland saw again the light in the
keep. But he had ceased to fear. "Oh All-Being,
how rich and stately and various and surprising
you are!" In the morning, outside in the court,
he found Black Alan saddled.</p>

<p>"The laird will be riding to Black Hill," said
Tam Dickson.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>


<p>Mr. Archibald Touris put out a wrinkled
hand to his wine-glass. "You have been in
warm countries. I envy you! I wish that I could
get warm."</p>

<p>"Black Hill is looking finely. All the young
trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. I took pride in planting.&mdash;But what for&mdash;what
for&mdash;what for?" He shivered. "Glenfernie,
please close that window!"</p>

<p>Alexander, coming back, stood above the master
of Black Hill. "Will you tell me, sir, where Ian is
now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Touris twitched back a little in his chair.
"Don't you know? I thought perhaps that you
did."</p>

<p>"I ceased to follow him two years ago. I dived
into the East, and I have been long where you do
not hear from the West."</p>

<p>The other fingered his wine-glass. "Well, I
haven't heard myself, for quite a while.... You
would think that he might come back to England
now. But he can't. Doubtless he would never wish
to come again to Black Hill. But England, now....
But they are ferocious yet against every head
great and small of the attempt. And I am told
<a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>there are aggravating circumstances. He had worn
the King's coat. He was among the plotters and
instigators. He broke prison. Impossible to show
mercy!" Mr. Touris twitched again. "That's a
phrase like a gravestone! If the Almighty uses it,
then of course he can't be Almighty.... Well, the
moral is that none named Ian Rullock can come
again to Scotland or England."</p>

<p>"Have you knowledge that he wishes to do so?"</p>

<p>Mr. Touris moved again. "I don't know.... I
told you that we hadn't heard. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and sat staring into his wine-glass.
Alexander read on as by starlight: "<i>But I did hear&mdash;through
old channels. And there is danger of his
trying to return.</i>"</p>

<p>The master of Black Hill put the wine to his lips.
"And so you have been everywhere?"</p>

<p>"No. But in places where I had not been before."</p>

<p>"The East India has ways of gathering information.
Through Goodworth I can get at a good deal
when I want to.... There is Wotherspoon, also. I
am practically certain that Ian is in France."</p>

<p>"When did he write?"</p>

<p>"Alison has a letter maybe twice a year. One's
overdue now."</p>

<p>"How does he write?"</p>

<p>"They are very short. He doesn't touch on old
things&mdash;except, perhaps, back into boyhood. She
likes to get them. When you see her, don't speak
of anything save his staying in France, as he ought
to." He dragged toward him a jar of snuff. "There
are informers and seekers out everywhere. Do you
remember a man in Edinburgh named Gleig?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, he's one of them. And for some reason
he has a personal enmity toward Ian. So, you
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence, a small, aging, chilly,
wrinkled, troubled man. Then with suddenness a
wintry red crept into his cheek, a brightness into
his eyes. "You've changed so, Glenfernie, you've
cheated me! You are his foe yourself. Perhaps
even&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps even&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The other gave a shriveled response to the smile.
"No. I certainly did not mean that." He took
his head in his hands and sighed. "What a world
it is! As I go down the hill I wish sometimes that
I had Alison's eyes.... Well, tell me about yourself."</p>

<p>"The one thing that I want to tell you just now,
Black Hill, is that I am not any longer bloodhound
at the heels of Ian. What was done is done. Let
us go on to better things. So at last will be unknit
what was done."</p>

<p>Black Hill both seemed and did not seem to pay
attention. The man who sat before him was big
and straight and gave forth warmth and light. He
needed warmth and light; he needed a big tree to
lean against. He vaguely hoped that Glenfernie
was home to stay. He rubbed his hands and drank
more wine.</p>

<p>"No one has known for a long time where you
were.... Goodworth has an agent in Paris who says
that Ian tried once to find out that."</p>

<p>"To find out where I was?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>Alexander gazed out of window, beyond the terrace
and the old trees to the long hill, purple with
heath, sunny and clear atop.</p>

<p>A servant came to the door. "Mrs. Alison has
returned, sir."</p>

<p>Glenfernie rose. "I will go find her then.&mdash;I will
ride over often if I may."</p>

<p>"I wish you would!" said Black Hill. "I was
sorry about that quarrel with your father."</p>

<p>The old laird's son walked down the matted corridor.
The drawing-room door stood open; he saw
one panel of the tall screen covered with pagodas,
palms, and macaws. Further on was the room,
clean and fragrant, known as Mrs. Alison's room.
This door, too, was wide. He stood by his old
friend. They put hands into hands; eyes met,
eyes held in a long look.</p>

<p>She said, "O God, I praise Thee!"</p>

<p>They sat within the garden door, on one side the
clear, still room, on the other the green and growing
things, the great tree loved by birds. The place was
like a cloister. He stayed with her an hour, and in
all that time there was not a great deal said with
the outer tongue. But each grew more happy,
deeper and stronger.</p>

<p>He talked to her of the Roman Campagna, of the
East and the desert....</p>

<p>As the hour closed he spoke directly of Ian.
"That is myself now, as Elspeth is myself now. I
falter, I fail, but I go on to profounder Oneness."</p>

<p>"Christ is born, then he grows up."</p>

<p>"May I see Ian's last letters?"</p>

<p>She put them in his hands. "They are very
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>short. They speak almost always of external
things."</p>

<p>He read, then sat musing, his eyes upon the tree.
"This last one&mdash;You answered that it was not
known where I was?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But he says here at the last, 'I feel it
somewhere that he is on his way to Scotland.'"</p>

<p>"I'll have to think it out."</p>

<p>"Every letter is objective like this. But for all
that, I divine, in the dark, a ferment.... As you
see, we have not heard for months."</p>

<p>The laird of Glenfernie rode at last from Black
Hill. It was afternoon, white drifts of clouds in
the sky, light and shadow moving upon field and
moor and distant, framing mountains. He rode
by Littlefarm and he called at the house gate for
Robin Greenlaw. It seemed that the latter was
away in White Farm fields. The laird might meet
him riding home. A mile farther on he saw the
gray horse crossing the stream.</p>

<p>Glenfernie and Greenlaw, meeting, left each the
saddle, went near to embracing, sat at last by a
stone wall in the late sunshine, and felt a tide of
liking, stronger, not weaker, than that of old days.</p>

<p>"You are looking after White Farm?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The old man fails. Jenny has become a
cripple. Gilian and I are the rulers."</p>

<p>"Or servers?"</p>

<p>"It amounts to the same.... Gilian has a splendid
soul."</p>

<p>"The poems, Robin. Do you make them yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Now and then. All this helps....
And you, Glenfernie, I could make a poem of you!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>The laird laughed. "I suppose you could of
all men.... Gilian and you do not marry?"</p>

<p>"We are not the marrying kind. But I shouldn't
love beauty inside if I didn't love Gilian.... I see
that something big has come to you, Glenfernie,
and made itself at home. You'll be wanting it
taken as a matter of course, and I take it that way....
No matter what you have seen, is not this vale
fair?"</p>

<p>"Fair as fair! Loved because of child and boy
and man.... Robin, something beyond all years as
we count them can be put into moments.... A
moment can be as sizable as a sun."</p>

<p>"I believe it. We are all treading toward the
land of wonders."</p>

<p>When he parted from Robin it was nearly sunset.
He did not mean to stop to-day at White Farm,
but he turned Black Alan in that direction. He
would ride by the house and the shining stream with
the stepping-stones. Coming beneath the bank
thick with willow and aspen, he checked the horse
and sat looking at the long, low house. It held
there in a sunset stillness, a sunset glory, a dream of
dawn. He dismounted, left the horse, and climbed
to the strip of green before the place. None seemed
about, all seemed within. Here was the fir-tree
with the bench around&mdash;so old a tree, watching life
so long!... Now he saw that Jarvis Barrow sat
here. But the old man was asleep. He sat with
closed eyes, and his Bible was under his hand. Beside
him, tall and fair, wide-browed, gray-eyed,
stood Gilian. Her head was turned toward the
fringed bank; when she saw Alexander she put her
<a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>finger against her lips. He made a gesture of understanding
and went no nearer. For a moment he
stood regarding all, then drew back into shadow of
willow and aspen, descended the bank, and, mounting
Black Alan, rode home through the purple light.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>


<p>The countryside, the village&mdash;the Jardine Arms&mdash;Mrs.
Macmurdo in her shop to all who entered&mdash;talked
of the laird's homecoming. "He's a
strange sort!"</p>

<p>"Some do say he's been to America and found a
gold-mine."</p>

<p>"Na! He's just been journeying around in himself."</p>

<p>"I am na spekalative. He's contentit, and sae
am I. It's a mair natural warld than ye think."</p>

<p>"Three year syne when he went away, he lookit
like ane o' thae figures o' tragedy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aweel, then, he's swallowed himself and digested
it."</p>

<p>"I ca' it fair miracle! The Lord touched him in
the night."</p>

<p>"Do ye haud that he'll gang to kirk the morn?"</p>

<p>"I dinna precisely ken. He micht, and he micht
not."</p>

<p>He went, entering with Mrs. Grizel, Alice, and
Strickland, sitting in the House pew. How many
kirks he thought of, sitting there&mdash;what cathedrals,
chapels; what rude, earnest places; what temples,
mosques, caves, ancient groves; what fanes; what
worshiped gods! One, one! Temple and image,
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>worshiped and worshiper. Self helping self. "O
my Self, daily and deeply help myself!"</p>

<p>The little white stone building&mdash;the earnest,
strenuous, narrow man in the pulpit, the Scots congregation&mdash;old,
old, familiar, with an inner odor
not unpungent, not unliked! Life Everlasting&mdash;Everlasting
Life....</p>

<p>"<i>That ye may have life and have it more abundantly.</i>"</p>

<p>White Farm sat in the White Farm place. Jarvis
Barrow was there. But he did not sit erect as of
yore; he leaned upon his staff. Jenny was missed.
Lame now, she stayed at home and watched the
passing, and talked to herself or talked to others.
Gilian sat beside the old man. Behind were Menie
and Merran, Thomas and Willy. Glenfernie's eyes
dwelt quietly upon Jarvis and his granddaughter.
When he willed he could see Elspeth beside
Gilian.</p>

<p>The prayers, the sermon, the hymns.... All
through the world-body the straining toward the
larger thing, the enveloping Person! As he sat
there he felt blood-warmth, touch, with every foot
that sought hold, with every hand that reached.
He saw the backward-falling, and he saw that they
did not fall forever, that they caught and held and
climbed again. He saw that because he had done
that, time and time again done that.</p>

<p>Mr. M'Nab preached a courageous, if harsh, sermon.
The old words of commination! They were
not empty&mdash;but in among them, fine as ether, now
ran a gloss.... The sermon ended, the final psalm
was sung.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a></p>
<span class="i0">"When Zion's bondage God turned back,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As men that dreamed were we.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then filled with laughter was our mouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our tongue with melody&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the Scots congregation went out, to the eye
sober, stern, and staid. Glenfernie spoke to Jarvis
Barrow. He meant to do no more than give a
word of greeting. But the old man put forth an
emaciated hand and held him.</p>

<p>"Is it the auld laird? My eyes are na gude.&mdash;Eh,
laird, I remember the sermons of your grandfather,
Gawin Elliot! Aye, aye! he was a lion
against sinners! I hae seen them cringe!... It
is the auld laird, Gilian?"</p>

<p>"No, Grandfather. You remember that the old
laird was William. This is Mr. Alexander."</p>

<p>"He that was always aff somewhere alane?"
White Farm drew his mind together. "I see now!
You're right. I remember."</p>

<p>"I am coming to White Farm to-morrow, Mr.
Barrow."</p>

<p>"Come then.... Is Grierson slain?"</p>

<p>"He's away in past time," said Gilian. "Grandfather,
here's Willy to help you.&mdash;Don't say anything
more to him now, Glenfernie."</p>

<p>The next day he rode to White Farm. Jenny,
through the window, saw him coming, but Jarvis
Barrow, old bodily habits changing, lay sleeping on
his own bed. Nor was Gilian at hand. The laird
sat and talked with Jenny in the clean, spare living-room.
All the story of her crippling was to be told,
and a packed chest of country happenings gone over.
Jenny had a happy, voluble half-hour. At last,
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>the immediate bag exhausted, she began to cast
her mind in a wider circle. Her words came at a
slower pace, at last halted. She sat in silence, an
apple red in her cheeks. She eyed askance the man
over against her, and at last burst forth:</p>

<p>"Gilian said I should na speir&mdash;but, eh, Glenfernie,
I wad gie mair than a bawbee to ken what
you did to him!"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Naething?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that you would call anything."</p>

<p>Jenny sat with open mouth. "They said you'd
changed, even to look at&mdash;and sae you have!&mdash;<i>Naething!</i>"</p>

<p>Jarvis Barrow entered the room, and with him
came Gilian. The old man failed, failed. Now he
knew Glenfernie and spoke to him of to-day and of
yesterday&mdash;and now he addressed him as though
he were his father, the old laird, or even his grandfather.
And after a few minutes he said that he
would go out to the fir-tree. Alexander helped him
there. Gilian took the Bible and placed it beside
him.</p>

<p>"Open at eleventh Isaiah," he said. "'<i>And there
shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
Branch shall grow out of his roots&mdash;</i>'"</p>

<p>Gilian opened the book. "You read," and she
sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"I wish to talk to you," said Alexander to her.
"When&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am going to town to-morrow afternoon. I'll
walk back over the moor."</p>

<p>When he came upon the moor next day it was
<a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>bathed by a sun half-way down the western quarter.
The colors of it were lit, the vast slopes had alike
tenderness and majesty. He moved over the moor;
then he sat down by a furze-bush and waited.
Gilian came at last, sat down near him in the dry,
sweet growth. She put her arms over her knees;
she held her head back and drank the ineffable rich
compassion of the sky. She spoke at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, laird, life's a marvel!"</p>

<p>"I feel the soul now," he said, "of marigolds and
pansies. That is the difference to me."</p>

<p>"What shall you do? Stay here and grow&mdash;or
travel again and grow?"</p>

<p>"I do not yet know.... It depends."</p>

<p>"It depends on Ian, does it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Now you speak as Gilian and now you
speak as Elspeth."</p>

<p>"That is the marvel of the world.... That Person
whom we call Being has also a long name.&mdash;My
name, her name, your name, his name, its
name, all names! Side by side, one over another,
one through another.... Who comes out but just
that Person?"</p>

<p>They sat and watched the orb that itself, with its
members the planets, went a great journey. Gilian
began to talk about Elspeth. She talked with quietness,
with depth, insight, and love, sitting there on
the golden moor. Elspeth&mdash;childhood and girlhood
and womanhood. The sister of Elspeth spoke simply,
but the sifted words came from a poet's granary.
She made pictures, she made melodies for
Alexander. Glints of vision, fugitive strains of
music, echoes of a quaint and subtle mirth, some<a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>thing
elemental, faylike&mdash;that was Elspeth. And
lightning in the south in summer, just shown, swiftly
withdrawn&mdash;power and passion&mdash;sudden similitudes
with great love-women of old story&mdash;that also was
Elspeth. And a crying and calling for the Star that
gathers all stars&mdash;that likewise was Elspeth. Such
and such did Elspeth show herself to Gilian. And
that half-year that they knew about of grief and
madness&mdash;it was not scanted nor its misery denied!
It, too, was, or had been, of Elspeth. Deep through
ages, again and again, something like that might
have worked forth. But it was not all nor most of
that nature&mdash;had not been and would not be&mdash;would
not be&mdash;would not be. The sister of Elspeth
spoke with pure, convinced passion as to that.
Who denied the dark? There were the dark and
the light, and the million million tones of each!
And there was the eternal space where differences
trembled into harmony.</p>

<p>With the sunset they moved over the great, clean
slope to where it ran down to fields and trees. Before
them was White Farm, below them the glistening
stream, coral and gold between and around the
stepping-stones. They parted here, Gilian going on
to the house, the laird turning again over the moor.</p>

<p>He passed the village; he came by the white kirk
and the yew-trees and the kirkyard. All were
lifted upon the hilltop, all wore the color of sunset
and the color of dawn. The laird of Glenfernie
moved beside the kirkyard wall. He seemed to
hold in his hand marigolds, pinks, and pansies. He
saw a green mound, and he seemed to put the flowers
there, out of old custom and tenderness. But
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>no longer did he feel that Elspeth was beneath the
mound. A wide tapering cloud, golden-feathered, like
a wing of glory, stretched half across the sky. He
looked at it; he looked at that in which it rested.
His lips moved, he spoke aloud.</p>

<p>"<i>O Death! where is thy sting? O grave! where
is thy victory?</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>


<p>Days and weeks went by. Autumn came and
stepped in russet toward winter. Yet it was
not cold and the mists and winds delayed. The homecoming
of the laird of Glenfernie slipped into received
fact&mdash;a fact rather large, acceptable, bringing into
the neighborhood situation of things in general a
perceptible amount of expansion and depth, but
settling now, for the general run, into comfortable
every-day. They were used&mdash;until these late years&mdash;to
seeing a laird of Glenfernie about. When he
was not there it was a missed part of the landscape.
When he was in presence Nature showed herself
correctly filled out. This laird was like and not like
the old lairds. Big like the one before him in outward
frame and seeming, there were certainly inner differences.
Dale and village pondered these differences.
It came at last to a judgment that this
Glenfernie was larger and kinder. The neighborhood
considered that he would make a good home body,
and if he was a scholar, sitting late in the old keep
over great books, that harmed no one, redounded,
indeed, to the dale's credit. His very wanderings
might so redound now that they were over. "That's
the laird of Glenfernie," the dale might say to
strangers.</p>

<p><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>It was dim, gray, late November weather. There
poured rain, shrieked a wind. Then the sky cleared
and the air stilled. There came three wonderful
days, one after the other, and between them wonderful
nights with a waxing moon. Alexander, riding
home from Littlefarm, found waiting for him in the
court Peter Lindsay, of Black Hill. This was a trusted
man.</p>

<p>"I hae a bit letter frae Mistress Alison, laird."
Giving it to him, Peter came close, his eye upon the
approaching stable-boy. "Dinna look at it here,
but when ye're alone. I'll bide and tak the answer."</p>

<p>Alexander nodded, turned, and crossed to the
keep. Within its ancient, deep entrance he broke
seal and opened the paper superscribed by Mrs.
Alison. Within was not her handwriting. There
ran but two lines, in a hand with which he was well
acquainted:</p>

<p>"<i>Will you meet one that you know in the cave to-night
four hours after moonrise?</i>"</p>

<p>He went back to the messenger. "The answer
is, 'Yes.' Say just that, Peter Lindsay."</p>

<p>The day went by. He worked with Strickland.
The latter thought him a little absent, but the accounts
were checked and decisions made. At the
supper-table he was more quiet than usual.</p>

<p>"Full moon to-night," said Alice. "What does it
look like, Alexander, when it shines in Rome and
when it comes up right out of the desert?"</p>

<p>"It lights the ruins and it is pale day in the desert.
What makes you think to-night of Rome and the
desert?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I see the rim now out of window."</p>

<p><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>The moon climbed. It shone with an intense
silver behind leafless boughs and behind the dark-clad
boughs of firs. It came above the trees. The
night hung windless and deeply clear. A fire burned
upon the hearth of the room in the keep. Alexander
sat before it and he sat very still, and vast pictures
came to the inner eye, and to the inner ear meanings
of old words....</p>

<p>He rose at last, took a cloak, and went down the
stone stair into a night cold, still, and bright. The
path by the school-house, the hand's-breadth of silvered
earth, the broken, silvered wall, the pine, the
rough descent.... He went through the dark wood
where the shining fell broken like a shattered mirror.
Beyond held open country until he came to the
glen mouth. The moon was high. He heard faint
sounds of the far night-time, and his own step upon
the silver earth. He came to the glen and the sound
of water streaming to the sea.</p>

<p>How well he knew this place! Thick trees spread
arms above, rock that leaned darkened the narrow
path. But his foot knew where to tread. In some
more open span down poured the twice-broken light;
then came darkness. There was a great checkering
of light and darkness and the slumbrous sound of
water. The path grew steeper and rougher. He was
approaching the middle of the place.</p>

<p>At last he came to the cave mouth and the leafless
briers that curtained it. Just before it was reached,
the moonbeams struck through clear air. There was
a silver lightness. A form moved from where it had
rested against the rock. Ian's voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Alexander?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>"Yes, it is I."</p>

<p>"The night is so still. I heard you coming a long
way off. I have lighted a fire in the cave."</p>

<p>They entered it&mdash;the old boyhood haunt. All the
air was moted for them with memories. Ian had
made the fire and had laid fagots for mending. The
flame played and murmured and reddened the walls.
The roof was high, and at one place the light smoke
made hidden exit. It was dead night. Even in the
daytime the glen was a solitary place.</p>

<p>Alexander put down his cloak. He looked about
the place, then, squarely turning, looked at Ian.
Long time had passed since they had spoken each
to other in Rome. Now they stood in that ancient
haunt where the very making of the fire sang of the
old always-done, never-to-be-omitted, here in the
cave. The light was sufficient for each to study the
other's face. Alexander spoke:</p>

<p>"You have changed."</p>

<p>"And you. Let us sit down. There is much that
I want to say."</p>

<p>They sat, and again it was as they used to do,
with the fire between them, but out of plane, so that
they might fully view each other. The cave kept
stillness. Subtly and silently its walls became penetrable.
They crumbled, dissolved. Around now was
space and the two were men.</p>

<p>Ian looked worn, with a lined face. But the old
brown-gold splendor, though dusked over, drew yet.
No one might feel him negligible. And something
was there, quivering in the dusk.... He and
Alexander rested without speech&mdash;or rather about
them whirled inaudible speech&mdash;intuitions, divina<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>tions.
At last words formed themselves. Ian
spoke:</p>

<p>"I came from France on the chance that you were
here.... For a long time I have been driven,
driven, by one with a scourge. Then that changed
to a longing. At last I resolved.... The driving
was within&mdash;as within as longing and determination.
I have heard Aunt Alison say that every myth, all
world stories, are but symbols, figures, of what goes
on within. Well, I have found out about the Furies,
and about some other myths."</p>

<p>"Yes. They tried to tell inner things."</p>

<p>"I came here to say that I wronged folk from whom
a man within me cannot part. One is dead, and I
have to seek her along another road. But you are
living, breathing there! I made myself your foe,
and now I wish that I could unmake what I made....
I was and am a sinful soul.... It is for you
to say if it is anything to you, what I confess." He
rose from the fire and moved once or twice the length
of the place. At last he came and stood before the
other. "It is no wonder if it be not given," he said.
"But I ask your forgiveness, Alexander!"</p>

<p>"Well, I give it to you," said Alexander. His face
worked. He got to his feet and went to Ian. He
put his hands upon the other's shoulders. "<i>Old
Saracen!</i>" he said.</p>

<p>Ian shook. With the dropping of Alexander's
hands he went back a step; he sat down and hid his
head in his arms.</p>

<p>Said Alexander: "You did thus and thus, obeying
inner weakness, calling it all the time strength. And
do I not know that I, too, made myself a shadow
<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>going after shadows? My own make of selfishness,
arrogance, and hatred.... Let us do better, you
and I!" He mended the fire. "By understanding
the past may be altered. Already it is altered with
you and me.... I was here the other day. I
stayed a long time. There seemed two boys in the
cave and there seemed a girl beside them. The three
felt with and understood and were one another."
He came and knelt beside Ian. "Let us forge a
stronger friendship!"</p>

<p>Ian, face to the rock, was weeping, weeping. Alexander
knelt beside him, lay beside him, arm over
heaving shoulders. Old Steadfast&mdash;Old Saracen&mdash;and
Elspeth Barrow, also, and around and through,
pulsing, cohering, interpenetrating, healing, a sense
of something greater....</p>

<p>It passed&mdash;the torrent force, long pent, aching
against its barriers. Ian lay still, at last sat up.</p>

<p>"Come outside," said Alexander, "into the cold
and the air."</p>

<p>They left the cave for the moonlight night. They
leaned against the rock, and about them hung the
sleeping trees. The crag was silvered, the stream
ran with a deep under-sound. The air struck pure
and cold. The large stars shone down through all the
flooding radiance of the moon. The familiar place,
the strange place, the old-new place.... At last
Ian spoke, "Have you been to the Kelpie's Pool?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The day I came home I lay for hours beside
it."</p>

<p>"I was there to-night. I came here from there."</p>

<p>"It is with us. But far beside it is also with
us!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>"The carnival at Rome. When I left Rome I went
to the Lake of Como. I want to tell you of a night
there&mdash;and of nights and days later, elsewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come within, as we used to do, and talk the heart
out."</p>

<p>They went back to the fire. It played and sang.
The minutes, poignant, full, went by.</p>

<p>"So at last prison and scaffold risks ceased to
count. I took what disguise I could and came."</p>

<p>"All at Black Hill know?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But they are not betrayers. I do not show
myself and am not called by my name. I am Se&ntilde;or
Nobody."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Nobody."</p>

<p>"When I broke Edinburgh gaol I fled to France
through Spain. There in the mountains I fell among
brigands. I had to find ransom. Se&ntilde;or Nobody
provided it. I never saw him nor do I know his
name.... Alexander!"</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"Was it you?"</p>

<p>"Aye. I hated while I gave.... But I don't
hate now. I don't hate myself. Ian!"</p>

<p>The fire played, the fire sang.</p>

<p>Alexander spoke: "Now your bodily danger
again&mdash;You've put your head into the lion's
mouth!"</p>

<p>"That lion weighs nothing here."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you came. But now I wish to
see you go!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I must go."</p>

<p>"Is it back to France?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or to America. I do not know. I have
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>thought of that. But here, first, I thought that I
should go to White Farm."</p>

<p>"It would add risk. I do not think that it is
needed."</p>

<p>"Jarvis Barrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The old man lies abed and his wits wander. He
would hardly know you, I think&mdash;would not understand.
Leave him now, except as you find him
within."</p>

<p>"Her sister?"</p>

<p>"I will tell Gilian. That is a wide and wise spirit.
She will understand."</p>

<p>"Then it is come and gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Disappear as you appeared! None here wants
your peril, and the griefs and evils were you taken."</p>

<p>"I expected to go back. The brig <i>Seawing</i>
brought me. It sails in a week's time."</p>

<p>"You must be upon it, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so." He drew a long, impatient
breath. "Let us leave all that! Sufficient to the
day&mdash;I wander and wander, and there are stones
and thorns&mdash;and Circe, too!... You have the
steady light, but I have not! The wind blows it&mdash;it
flickers!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I know flickering, too!"</p>

<p>"Is there a great Se&ntilde;or Somebody? Sometimes I
feel it&mdash;and then there is only the wild ass in the
desert! The dust blinds and the mire sticks."</p>

<p>"Ah, Old Saracen&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other pushed the embers together. "This
cave&mdash;this glen.... Do you remember that time
we were in Amsterdam and each dreamed one night
the same dream?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>"I remember."</p>

<p>The fire was sinking for the night. The moon was
down in the western sky. Around and around the
cave and the glen and the night the inner ear heard,
as it were, a long, faint, wordless cry for help. Alexander
brooded, brooded, his eyes upon the lessening
flame. At last, with a sudden movement, he rose.
"I smell the morning air. Let us be going!"</p>

<p>The two covered the embers and left the cave.
The moon stood above the western rim of the glen,
the sound of the water was deep and full, frost hung
in the air, the trees great and small stood quiet, in a
winter dream. Ian and Alexander climbed the glen-side,
avoiding Mother Binning's cot. Now they were
in open country, moving toward Black Hill.</p>

<p>The walk was not a short one. Daybreak was just
behind the east when they came to the long heath-grown
hill that faced the house, the purple ridge
where as boys they had met. They climbed it, and
in the east was light. Beneath them, among the
trees, Black Hill showed roof and chimney. Then
up the path toward them came Peter Lindsay.</p>

<p>He seemed to come in haste and a kind of fear.
When he saw the two he threw up his hands, then violently
gestured to them to go back upon their path,
drop beneath the hilltop. They obeyed, and he came
to them himself, panting, sweat upon him for all the
chill night. "Mr. Ian&mdash;Laird! Sogers at the house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Twelve of them. They rade in an hour syne.
The lieutenant swears ye're there, Mr. Ian, and they
search the house. Didna ye see the lights? Mrs. Alison
tauld me to gae warn ye&mdash;"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>


<p>The soldiers, having fruitlessly searched Black
Hill, for the present set up quarters there,
and searched the neighborhood. They gave a wide
cast to that word. It seemed to include all this part
of Scotland. Before long they appeared, not unforeseen,
at Glenfernie.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was a wiry, wide-nostriled man,
determined to please superiors and win promotion.
He had now men at the Jardine Arms no less than
men at Black Hill. Face to face with the laird of
Glenfernie in the latter's hall, he explained his
errand.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Glenfernie. "I saw you coming up
the hill. Will you take wine?"</p>

<p>"To your health, sir!"</p>

<p>"To your health!"</p>

<p>The lieutenant set down the glass and wiped his
lips. "I have orders, Mr. Jardine, which I may not
disobey."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"My duty, therefore, brings me in at your door&mdash;though
of course I may say that you and your
household are hardly under suspicion of harboring
a proscribed rebel! A good Whig"&mdash;he bowed stiffly&mdash;"a
volunteer serving with the Duke in the late
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>trouble, and, last but not least, a personal enemy of
the man we seek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The catalogue is ample!" said Glenfernie. "But
still, having your orders to make no exception, you
must search my house. It is at your service. I will
show you from room to room."</p>

<p>Lieutenant and soldiers and laird went through
the place, high and low and up and down. "Perfunctory!"
said the lieutenant twice. "But we must
do as we are told!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the laird. "This is my sister's garden.
The small building there is an old school-room."</p>

<p>They met Alice walking in the garden, in the
winter sunshine. Strickland, too, joined them here.
Presentations over, the lieutenant again repeated his
story.</p>

<p>"Perfunctory, of course, here&mdash;perfunctory! The
only trace that we think we have we found in a glen
near you. There is a cave there that I understand
he used to haunt. We found ashes, still warm,
where had been a fire. Pity is, the ground is so frozen
no footstep shows!"</p>

<p>"You are making escape difficult," said Strickland.</p>

<p>"I flatter myself that we'll get him between here
and the sea! I am going presently," said the lieutenant,
"to a place called White Farm. But I am
given to understand that there are good reasons&mdash;saving
the lady's presence&mdash;why he'll find no shelter
there."</p>

<p>"Over yonder is the old keep," said Glenfernie.
"When that is passed, I think you will have seen
everything."</p>

<p>They left Strickland and Alice and went to the
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>keep. Their footsteps and those of the soldiers
behind them rang upon the stone stairs.</p>

<p>"Above is the room," said the laird of Glenfernie,
"where as a boy I used to play at alchemy. I built
a furnace. I had an intention of making lead into
gold. I keep old treasures there still, and it is still
my dear old lair&mdash;though with a difference as I
travel on, though with a difference, Lieutenant, as we
travel on!"</p>

<p>They came into the room, quiet, filled with books
and old apparatus, with a burning fire, with sunlight
and shadow dappling floor and wall. "Well, he
would hardly hide here!" said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Not by received canons," answered Glenfernie.</p>

<p>The lieutenant spoke to the soldiers. "Go about
and look beneath and behind matters. There are
no closets?"</p>

<p>"There are only these presses built against the
stone." The laird opened them as he spoke. "You
see&mdash;blank space!" He moved toward a corner.
"This structure is my ancient furnace of which I
spoke. I still keep it fuel-filled for firing." As he
spoke he opened a sizable door.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, stooping, saw the piled wood. "I
don't know much of alchemy," he said. "I've never
had time to get around to those things. It's bringing
out sleeping values isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Something like that." He shut the furnace door,
and they stood watching the soldiers search the room.
In no long time this stood a completed process.</p>

<p>"Perfunctory!" said again the lieutenant. "Now
men, we'll to White Farm!"</p>

<p>"There is food and drink for them below, on this
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>chilly day," said the laird, "and perhaps in the hall
you'll drink another glass of wine?"</p>

<p>All went down the stairs and out of the keep.
Another half-hour and the detail, lieutenant and men,
mounted and rode away. Glenfernie and Strickland
watched them down the winding road, clear of the
hill, out upon the highway.</p>

<p>Alexander went back alone to the keep that, also,
from its widened loopholes, might watch the searchers
ride away. He mounted the stair; he came into
his old room. Ian stood beside the table. The
sizable furnace door hung open, the screen of heaped
wood was disarranged.</p>

<p>"It was a good notion, that recess behind my old
furnace!" said Glenfernie. "You took no harm beyond
some cobwebs and ashes?"</p>

<p>"None, Se&ntilde;or Nobody," said Ian.</p>

<p>That day went by. The laird and Strickland
talked together in low voices in the old school-room.
Davie, too, appeared there once, and an old, trusted
stableman. At sunset came Robin Greenlaw, and
stayed an hour. The stars shone out, around drew
a high, windy crystal night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grizel went to bed. Alexander, with Alice
and Strickland, sat by the fire in the hall. There
was much that the laird wished to say that he said.
They spoke in low voices, leaning toward the burning
logs, the light playing over their faces, the light
laughing upon old armor, crossed weapons, upon
the walls. Alice, a bonny woman with sense and courage,
sat beside Glenfernie. Strickland, from his
corner, saw how much she looked like her mother;
how much, to-night, Alexander looked like her.</p>

<p><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>They talked until late. They came to agreement,
quiet, moved, but thorough. Glenfernie rose. He
took Alice in his arms and kissed her thrice. Moisture
was in the eyes of both.</p>

<p>"Sleep, dear, sleep! So we understand, things
grow easy!"</p>

<p>"I think that you are right, and that is a long way
to comfort," said Alice. "Good night, good night,
Alexander!"</p>

<p>When she was gone the two men talked yet a little
longer, over the dying fire. Then they, too, wished
each other good night. Strickland went to his room,
but Alexander left the house and crossed the moon-filled
night to the keep. It was now he and Ian.</p>

<p>There was no strain. "Old Steadfast" and "Old
Saracen," and a long pilgrimage together, and every
difference granted, yet, in the background, a vast,
an oceanic unity.... Ian rose from the settle. He
and the laird of Glenfernie sat by the table and with
pen and paper made a diagram of escape. They
bent to the task in hand, and when it was done, and
a few more words had been said, they turned to the
pallets which Davie had spread on either side of the
hearth. The moon and the low fire made a strange
half-light in the room. The two lay still, addressed
to sleep. They spoke and answered but once.</p>

<p>Said Ian: "I felt just then the waves of the sea!&mdash;The
waves of the sea and the roads of France....
The waves and roads of the days and nights and
months and years. I there and you here. There is
an ether, doubtless, that links, but I don't tread it
firmly.... Be sure I'll turn to you, call to you,
often, over the long roads, from out of the trough
<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>of the waves! <i>Se&ntilde;or Nobody! Se&ntilde;or Nobody!</i>" He
laughed, but with a catch of the breath. "Good
night!"</p>

<p>"Good night, Old Saracen!" said Alexander.</p>

<p>Morn came. That day Glenfernie House heard
still that all that region was searched. The day went
by, short, gray, with flurries of snow. By afternoon
it settled to a great, down-drifting pall of white. It
was falling thick and fast when Alexander Jardine
and Ian Rullock passed through the broken wall beyond
the school-room. The pine branches were whitening,
the narrow, rugged path ran a zigzag of white.</p>

<p>Strickland had parted from them at the wall, and
yet Strickland seemed to be upon the path, following
Glenfernie. Ian wore a dress of Strickland's, a hat
and cloak that the countryside knew. He and
Strickland were nearly of a height. Keeping silence
and moving through a dimness of the descending
day and the shaken veil of the snow, almost any
chance-met neighbor would have said, in passing,
"Good day, Mr. Strickland!"</p>

<p>The path led into the wood. Trees rose about
them, phantoms in the snowstorm. The snow fell
in large flakes, straight, undriven by wind. Footprints
made transient shapes. The snow obliterated
them as in the desert moving sand obliterated. Ian
and Alexander, leaving the wood, took a way that
led by field and moor to Littlefarm.</p>

<p>The earth seemed a Solitary, with no child nor
lover of hers abroad. The day declined, the snow
fell. Ian and Alexander moved on, hardly speaking.
The outer landscape rolled dimmed, softened, withdrawn.
The inner world moved among its own con<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>tours.
The day flowed toward night, as the night
would flow toward day.</p>

<p>They came to the foot of the moor that stretched
between White Farm and Littlefarm.</p>

<p>"There is a woman standing by that tree," said
Ian.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is Gilian."</p>

<p>They moved toward her. Tall, fair, wide-browed
and gray-eyed, she leaned against the oak stem and
seemed to be at home here, too. The wide falling
snow, the mystic light and quietness, were hers for
mantle. As they approached she stirred.</p>

<p>"Good day, Glenfernie!&mdash;Good day, Ian Rullock!&mdash;Glenfernie,
you cannot go this way! Soldiers are
at Littlefarm."</p>

<p>"Did Robin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He got word to me an hour since. They are
chance-fallen, the second time. They will get no
news and soon be gone. He trusted me to give you
warning. He says wait for him at the cot that was
old Skene's. It stands empty and folk say that it is
haunted and go round about." She left the tree and
took the path with them. "It lies between us and
White Farm. This snow is friendly. It covers marks&mdash;it
keeps folk within-doors&mdash;nor does it mean to
fall too long or too heavily."</p>

<p>They moved together through the falling snow.</p>

<p>It was a mile to old Skene's cot. They walked it
almost in silence&mdash;upon Ian's part in silence. The
snow fell; it covered their footprints. All outlines
showed vague and looming. The three seemed three
vital points moving in a world dissolving or a world
forming.</p>

<p><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>The empty cot rose before them, the thatch
whitened, the door-stone whitened. Glenfernie
pushed the door. It opened; they found a clean,
bare place, twilight now, still, with the falling snow
without.</p>

<p>Gilian spoke. "I'll go on now to White Farm.
Robin will come. In no long time you'll be upon the
farther road.... Now I will say Fare you well!"</p>

<p>Alexander took her hands. "Farewell, Gilian!"</p>

<p>Gray eyes met gray eyes. "Be it short time or be
it long time&mdash;soon home to Glenfernie, or long, long
gone&mdash;farewell, and God bless you, Glenfernie!"</p>

<p>"And you, Gilian!"</p>

<p>She turned to Ian. "Ian Rullock&mdash;farewell, too,
and God bless you, too!"</p>

<p>She was gone. They watched through the door
her form moving amid falling snow. The veil between
thickened; she vanished; there were only the
white particles of the dissolving or the forming world.
The two kept silence.</p>

<p>Twilight deepened, night came, the snow ceased to
fall for a time, then began again, but less thickly.
One hour went by, two, three. Then came Robin
Greenlaw and Peter Lindsay, riding, and with them
horses for the two who waited at Skene's cot.</p>

<p>Four men rode through the December night. At
dawn they neared the sea. The snow fell no longer.
When the purple bars came into the east they saw
in the first light the huddled roofs of a small seaport.
Beyond lay gray water, with shipping in the harbor.</p>

<p>At a crossroads the party divided. Robin Greenlaw
and Peter Lindsay took a way that should lead
them far aside from this port, and then with circui<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>tousness
home. Before they reached it they would
separate, coming singly into their own dale, back to
Black Hill, back to Littlefarm. The laird of Glenfernie
and Littlefarm, dismounting, moving aside,
talked together for a few moments. Ian gave Peter
Lindsay a message for Mrs. Alison.... Good-bys
were said. Greenlaw remounted; he and Peter Lindsay
moved slowly from the two bound to the port.
A dip of the earth presently hid them. Alexander
and Ian were left in the gray dawn.</p>

<p>"Alexander, I know the safe house and the safe
man and the safe ship. Why should you run further
danger? Let us say good-by now!"</p>

<p>"No, not now."</p>

<p>"You have come to the edge of Scotland. Say
farewell here, and danger saved, rather than on the
water stairs in a little while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I will go farther, Ian. There is Mackenzie's
house, over there."</p>

<p>They rode through the winter dawn to the house
at the edge of the port, where lived a quiet man and
wife, under obligations to the Jardines. There
visited them now the laird of Glenfernie and his
secretary, Mr. Strickland.</p>

<p>The latter, it seemed, was not well&mdash;kept his room
that day. The laird of Glenfernie went about, indeed,
but never once went near the waterside....
And yet, at eve, the master of the <i>Seawing</i>, riding in
the harbor, took the resolution to sail by cockcrow.</p>

<p>The sun went down with red and gold, in a winter
splendor. Dark night followed, but, late, there rose
a moon. Alexander and Ian, coming down to the
harbor edge at a specified place, found there the wait<a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>ing
boat with two rowers. It hung before them on
the just-lit water. "Now, Old Steadfast, farewell!"
said Ian.</p>

<p>"I am going a little farther. Step in, man!"</p>

<p>The boat drove across, under the moon, to the
<i>Seawing</i>. The two mounted the brig's side and,
touching deck, found the captain, known to Ian, who
had sailed before upon the <i>Seawing</i>, and known
since yesterday to Glenfernie. The captain welcomed
them, his only passengers, using not their
own names, but others that had been chosen. In
the cabin, under the swinging lantern, there followed
a few words as to weather, ports, and sailing. The
tide served, the <i>Seawing</i> would be forth in an hour.
The captain, work calling, left them in the small
lighted place.</p>

<p>"The boat is waiting. Now, Old Steadfast&mdash;Se&ntilde;or
Nobody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old Saracen, we used to say that we'd go one
day to India&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let us go!"</p>

<p>"<i>Us</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>They stood with the table between them. Alexander's
hands moved toward Ian's. They took
hands; there followed a strong, a convulsive pressure.</p>

<p>"We sin in differing ways and at differing times,"
said Alexander, "but we all sin. And we all struggle
with it and through it and onward! And there must
be some kind of star upon our heights. Well, let us
work toward it together, Old Saracen!"</p>

<p><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>They went out of the cabin and upon the deck.
The boat that had brought them was gone. They saw
it in the moonlight, half-way back to the quay. On
the <i>Seawing</i>, sailors were lifting anchor. They stood
and watched. The moon was paling; there came
the scent of morning; far upon the shore a cock
crew. The <i>Seawing's</i> crew were making sail. Out
and up went her pinions, filled with a steady and
favoring wind. She thrilled; she moved; she left
the harbor for a new voyage, fresh wonder of the
eternal world.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
